<p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>

<p>Hope your week is awesome! 🌟 Did you get a chance to peep the Builds page on our website? 🏗️</p>

<p>If you had to pick, would you jet off to the <a href="https://livedifferent.com/programs/builds/all-builds/" target="_blank">Dominican Republic or Mexico</a>? Tough choice, right? We have Builds coming up in both of those countries!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote from a recent Build participant:</p>

<blockquote><em>&quot;In our group, we came together as individuals and left as a family. We laughed, cried, worked hard and played hard as a group. LiveDifferent taught us that life isn&rsquo;t about stuff, it&rsquo;s what is in our hearts.&quot;</em></blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in learning more, I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions that you have.</p>

<p>Excited to hear from you soon! 🤙</p>

<p>Stay curious,</p>

<p>Tyler</p>
