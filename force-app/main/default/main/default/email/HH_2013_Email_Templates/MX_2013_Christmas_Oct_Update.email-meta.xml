    <subject>MX Christmas Public Trip 2013 - One Month Payment Deadline</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey everyone!



Here&apos;s just a quick email to remind you to book your flights, send in your forms, and that the payment deadline is coming up soon.



Final payment deadline is coming up in a month on October 31st:

Use your Canada Helps Page for making, entering and requesting donations or payments related to your trip. You can share (email, Facebook, etc.) your Canada Helps Page with any potential donors so they can donate online to your Live Different Build project (to help meet your fundraising goal).

Family Profiles:

Our group of 40 will be split up into 3 teams to build for 3 families. Once we have finalized which families we are building for in which communities, I will email everyone with the names, ages, and information about the families. I can&apos;t wait!

GIFTS!

Live Different is trying to get away from the &quot;gift give away&quot; attitude within the communities that we are working in. We are finding that it has the potential to create unhealthy relationships and we desire to build relationships that are best for us as an organization, the community, and our volunteers. We ask that you come with only ONE checked bag (if possible). You are welcome to bring items for the family you are building for if you have extra room or some of the following items listed below. Please only bring items on this list and help us continue our work in the communities in a health manner. Thank you for honouring this request. We will provide more details on this point during our time together in Mexico.

new bed sheets
new towels (all sizes)
curtains
new table cloths
kitchen supplies - tupperware containers, cooking utensils, serving items, anything that you personally find helpful in the kitchen
bubbles
water guns
baby items
school supplies (notebooks and pens)



Through our extensive experience working with groups, we have found that the best way to help your family is to pool extra donated money together in the Mexico, to buy the larger items for their house. With this money, based on the family&apos;s need, we have been able to purchase things such as groceries, beds, table &amp; chairs, stove, fridge, and other much needed items. In doing this, we help assist the family into a new and healthy future. We also help support the local economy!


Upon Arrival:
All volunteers fly into the San Diego Airport and our staff will pick them up. Once all our volunteers have arrived we spend a night at the Best Western hotel in Chula Vista, CA. As a group, the next day, we drive down to Vicente Guerrero, Mexico. It&apos;s approximately 4 hours south of San Diego, along the Baja coast of California, but with stops it will take around 5 hours to get there.



Pick up and drop off:
Once you have booked your flights, please forward me your trip itinerary and I can add you to our bus shuttle. When you arrive at the San Diego airport, our staff will be at the gate wearing a Live Different t-shirt and holding a Live Different Build sign, and you will then be taken to the Best Western hotel for the night.
Please keep in mind that there are other volunteers on this trip, so our staff will be doing airport shuttles all day, which is one reason why we don&apos;t leave for Mexico until the following day.

After we drop off the volunteers at the airport on their last day, they get  on their flight and they&apos;re on their own from there on. All the  volunteers can be picked up on the other side by  their parents or other  family members.



Accommodations:
We own our own comfortable and clean homes on a gated property in the community of Zapata, Mexico. We have full time staff that live down in Mexico all year round that help host all our trips. All of our volunteers will be staying on our property while we are in Mexico.



Transportation:
We own all of our own buses, vans, and vehicles that are used to transport our volunteers from San Diego to Mexico, and from our homes to the communities we will be working in. The drivers are  staff that have experience driving in Mexico, as well as the legal documents to drive these registered vehicles.



Communities We Work In:
Since 2006, we have developed very strong relationships with the communities that we work in. The communities know Live Different very well and we feel very safe at all times while working on our building sites.



Work Site Safety:
We require all volunteers to bring down closed toed shoes, a hat/bandana, waterbottle, sunglasses, sunscreen, and leather work gloves. This ensures that volunteers are as equipped for handling equipment on the job sites.



Area We Live In:
The area that we live and work in is a rural area that survives on farming. It is extremely safe and quiet, volunteers often feel safer in Mexico than they do in their own neighborhoods in Canada.



Vaccinations and Medications:
We do not require that any of our volunteers receive any vaccinations or medications to go to any of the countries that we work in. But, we do suggest that every volunteer visit their family doctor or local medical clinic and decide on your own about taking any medications or vaccinations prior to the trip.



Map from US to MX:
Here is a map of our drive from the Best Western in Chula Vista, CA to our home in Zapata (a few minutes away from Vicente Guerrero): https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=%4030.771699,-116.006355&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en.



Excursion Day (trip specific):
There are a few options for the excursion day that our staff will decide on closer to the date of the trip (volcano hike, beach day, etc.). Whatever is decided on, please be aware that there are  many factors on our staff deciding where to takes our groups (depending  on whether, and multiple safety precautions).



Contact during a trip between volunteers and Canada:
There is wifi at the house that all volunteers to use 24/7 and are able to skype with their family members. We also have a facebook page that we update every day to keep family and friends informed. All of our staff have cell phones on them at all times and we also have a land line. We will be emailing everyone all of the emergency  contact information before the trip starts.
