    <textOnly>Hola Applicants!

Hope everyone had an amazing weekend. I just got back from my weekend off and it was freezing in Montreal. One of the nights was -18 degrees and I was definitely feeling like Christmas is just around the corner.

We will be choosing 10 Interns for Dominican Republic and 10 Interns for Mexico after our interviews, and contacting to let you know who will be on our team next summer.

I am very excited to have such a strong team of applicants and have high hopes that next summer is going to rock! I can&apos;t wait for our Dominican and Mexican communities to see what we have in store for them.

I just wanted everyone to know that we will be conducting interviews next week from Monday-Friday. Can you please email me with your choice of a time and date? Remember this is all in Ontario time, so please choose it to reflect your schedule.

All interviews will be around 30 minutes give or take!

December 9-13
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
8:30am - 2:00pm (some 3:00pm slots available if needed)


Please note: The phone interviews will be very casual and you do not have to &quot;prepare&quot; for it. It will be super laid back and just think about it as having a conversation with me. I am nice, I promise!

Here are some main point we will be discussing in our phone interviews:

Summer Schedule
Internship Responsibilities
Internship Assignments
Involvement before, during, and after the summer
Reviewing: Application and Essay
Scenario/Situation Assesment


If any of the time slots does not work with you, please e-mail me and we can work this out!

Talk to you soon,
