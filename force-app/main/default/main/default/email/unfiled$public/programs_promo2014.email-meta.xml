Destination: Dominican Republic

How would you like to spend three to four weeks working with our staff, as we host two Live Different trips and experience the power of change? If you answered &apos;yes&apos;, read on!

Our internship program is highly recommended for people who are looking to develop their international experience and leadership skills. As an intern, you will have the privilege to be a part of the behind-the-scenes work of a humanitarian trip. You will be able to develop your leadership skills by receiving practical, hands-on experience. Our interns are an integral part of what happens during our summer trips, building significant connections in both the communities we work in and with other volunteers.

Want a regular or private trip instead?

Check out our trips on Live Different, or ask us about setting up a private trip for 10 or more volunteers.

Destination: Mexico
Dates: September - December, 2015

During their time with us, our Academy students experience character development, social justice classes, local volunteering, and cross-cultural education. All of these aspects are focused on helping each student to see the part they play in changing and shaping the global future - starting with their own.

Through our semester of mentoring, leadership training, and practical hands-on experience, our students will be transformed through a program that is challenging, exciting, and affirming.
