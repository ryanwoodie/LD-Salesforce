    <subject>Meet Ismailove, a shy 9 year old who loves school!</subject>
    <textOnly>Inspiration.

That&apos;s what &apos;Ismailove&apos; was to Benjamin Cole

He originally met her the first time he climbed the hillside in Calvaire to see the new property which would become the home of Ecole L&apos;Union as we know it. She followed him all the way up the hill, and he managed to take a quick picture of her with the port of Cap Haitien in the background. Over the years he took numerous photographs of her including one on the first day of school in her new uniform.

Today, Ismailove is a shy 9 year old with 2 younger sisters and 1 older brother in grade 8. She lives with her mom and loves every subject at school! Her favourite colors are blue and red.</textOnly>
