Greetings from Haiti!

A few of our staff are at the school connecting with the community and school administration.  We want to try and live stream to all of your this afternoon at 2:30pm Eastern Time.  Please know that the tech connection can be poor, so we are not sure if this will be seamless, but we'll do our absolute best.  If it fails to live stream, no worries, we will record the footage and share a link to it in the coming days.  Today, we will be handing out Christmas gifts, going on a tour of the school, and learning a bit more about this mountainside school we love so much! 

Here is the link to the LIVE STREAM:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZECQZV938jE

Wish us luck!
