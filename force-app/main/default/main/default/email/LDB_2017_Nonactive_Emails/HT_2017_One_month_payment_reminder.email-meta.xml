    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for registering for the Live Different Build to Haiti in May of 2017!



Welcome to the Live Different team. My name is Joy and I am an Administrator for our trips. We&apos;re looking forward to meeting you in person and having you along on this trip as we work together to make a difference!

This Live Different Build is not only going to be an incredible opportunity to make a tangible difference for people that need it most, but also to have your entire world view changed!

Please review the following information to help you prepare for your trip:

Your Deposit is Due in Two Weeks:
- Your first $300 deposit needs to be made within 2 weeks of your registration to secure your spot on the trip. Please use your volunteer page to make your payment.

Forms Attached to this Email:
- Consent Forms - Please scan and email these forms back to me within 2 weeks of registration.
- Child Protection Policy - The Child Protection Policy is for volunteers 18 years of age or older to read before the trip. It is our  policy on what is appropriate behaviour when dealing with minors and the  steps that we take to protect them. It&apos;s important that you take the   time to read this from beginning to end.
- Child Protection Policy Agreement - Once you have read the above Child Protection Policy, please sign the agreement and send it to me. This can also be scanned and emailed, or faxed to me as we do not need the original copy.
- Letter to Donors - This a great tool for fund raising. Present this letter to potential donors and businesses when looking for donations towards your trip. It gives an explanation of who Live Different is and what Live Different Builds is  all about. It&apos;s also a good idea to include a letter from yourself explaining why you want to participate on a Live Different Build and what you hope to accomplish.
- Packing List  - No idea what to pack? Read this list and it will remind you of all the little things that will make your trip and travels more comfortable.

- Criminal Record Check - If you will be 18 years of age on the trip, you will be required to obtain a criminal record check. You can obtain one through your local police station, or ask me how to do it online.

Booking Your Flights:

Airport: Cap Haitien, Haiti - Airport Code: CAP
Arrival: May 5, 2017
Departure: May 14, 2017

Official Airline of Live Different: WestJet!
WestJet has given Live Different volunteers a way to save up to 10% on flights when travelling with Live Different Builds. Call the WestJet Groups Department at 1-888-493-7853 and give them the convention code: CC7946.

Once you have booked your flights, please upload the itinerary to your volunteer page.

Upon Arrival:
- When you arrive at the Cap Haitien Airport, our staff will be at the gate wearing a Live Different t-shirt and holding a Live Different sign.
- We will take you straight to the hotel that the whole group will be staying at and settle into the hotel to meet the team and debrief about the trip.

Accommodations:
- While in Haiti, we stay at a resort called Royal Residence. It is located 10 minutes away from where we build our school in a small town called Calvaire in the city of Cap Haitien.
- The rooms can fit up to 4 people in a room with 2-3 beds. There is a private pool that is  accessible for all volunteers.
- The hotel has security guards that monitor the resort at all  times to ensure our safety.
- Shower towels and bedding are provided by the hotel.

Transportation:
We hire bus drivers for transportation and they arrive every morning at the resort to take us to the communities we will be working in. The drivers are experienced drivers whom we have been working with since 2005. They have experience driving in Dominican Republic and Haiti, as well as the legal documents to drive these registered  vehicles.

Communities We Work In:
Since 2010, we have developed very strong  relationships with the community of Calvaire that we work in. The community knows  Live Different very well and we feel very safe at all times while  working on our building sites.

Work Site Safety:
We require all volunteers to bring closed toed shoes, a hat/bandana, waterbottle, sunglasses, sunscreen, and leather work gloves. This ensures that volunteers are as equipped for handling equipment on the job sites.

Vaccinations and Medications:
We do not require that any of our volunteers receive any vaccinations or medications to go to any of the countries that we work in. But, we do suggest that every volunteer visit their family doctor or local medical clinic and decide on your own about taking any medications or vaccinations prior to the trip.

Contact during a trip between volunteers and Canada:
- There is wifi available at the hotel. However, due to the fact that we will be using internet in a developing country, it will be hard for volunteers to receive a well enough connection to skype with their family members, but they can indeed use Facebook and e-mail.
- All of our staff have cell phones on them at all times. We will be emailing everyone all of the emergency contact information before the trip starts.

Resources:
Here are some photos, videos, and documents from our past Live Different Builds if you would like to use them for your fundraising needs or simply to share with friends and family about what your journey looked like ahead: http://livedifferent.com/resources

Media:
There are photos, blogs and videos from our past trips as well as our most recent trips, it&apos;s a great resource to help you prepare for your trip: http://livedifferent.com/media

Frequently Asked Questions:
Sometimes it is difficult to know what questions to ask before going on your trip, we have compiled a FAQ section based on our past volunteers: http://www.livedifferent.com/faqs

Thank you for taking the time to read the above information. If you have any questions at all, please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me. I&apos;m always here to help!
