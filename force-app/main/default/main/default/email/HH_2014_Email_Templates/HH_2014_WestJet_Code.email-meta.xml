    <subject>Live Different: Book Your Flights!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Volunteers!

As summer is quickly approaching, I encourage you to book your flights as soon as possible. Just a few reminders...

Airport
You will be flying into San Diego
Airport code is: SAN
August 6, 2014 - August 15, 2014

Official Airline of Live Different: WestJet!
WestJet has given Live Different volunteers a way to save 10% on flights when travelling for a Live Different Build. Call the WestJet Groups Department at 1-888-493-7853 and give them the convention code: CC7946.

On the phone: &quot;Hi there, I am hoping to book an individual flight using the convention code CC7946 to go on a Live Different Build trip.&quot;

Forwarding the Itinerary
Once you have booked your flights, please forward me your flight itinerary. We need to know when you are arriving and departing so that we can arrange airport shuttles.

If you have any questions, please let me know. I&apos;m here to help!
