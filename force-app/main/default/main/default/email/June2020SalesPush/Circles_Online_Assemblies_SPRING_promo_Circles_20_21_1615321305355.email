<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}!<br />
<br />
How has the year been going for you and your school?&nbsp; I wanted to touch base to&nbsp;let you know that we've been supporting a bunch of schools like yours with our interactive, live-streamed assemblies and the feedback has been awesome.&nbsp; Below, I've&nbsp;included a few quotes from educators we recently partnered with.</p>

<p><i>&quot;<span style="color:#555555;">The LiveDifferent Circles (assemblies)&nbsp;are perfect for the current times we live in. The presentations on &quot;Resilience&quot; and &quot;Empathy&quot; were both exactly what our students needed at this point in the year and the format kept them active and engaged.</span>&quot;</i>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px;">-&nbsp;<b>Principal in Saskatchewan</b></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>&quot;<span style="color:#555555;">Students shared quite a lot in the discussion sessions (which) suggests the video is engaging and questions are well-crafted.</span>&quot;</i>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px;">-&nbsp;<b>Vice Principal in Ontario</b></span><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;<span style="color:#555555;">Our LiveDifferent assembly on a 'Growth Mindset' was impactful for my students. The message was clear and concise, and used a good mix of humour and factual information.&nbsp;The interaction piece was unlike any other presentation that I have seen in 15 years...by having the students talk, I also believe it was personable and relatable...I would definitely show this assembly to a future class!</span>&quot;</i>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px;">-&nbsp;<b>Teacher in Ontario</b></span><br />
<br />
If you could take a minute and check out the programming here, I'd really appreciate it:&nbsp;<a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-assembly/">https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-assembly/</a><br />
<br />
I know it's been a difficult&nbsp;year, but no matter what challenges 2021 throws our way,&nbsp;we can still positively impact the lives of young people together. So, let's set up a time to chat!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks so much {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
