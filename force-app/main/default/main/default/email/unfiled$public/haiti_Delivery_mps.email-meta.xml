    <subject>Thank you, {!Contact.FirstName}, for your support in helping our friends in Haiti!</subject>
    <textOnly>Thank you for your continual support!

We would like to give a specific thank you and report to our Monthly Partners regarding our Haiti earthquake relief effort. Your consistent and committed financial partnership allowed us to maximize the one-time Haiti donations from others (and some of you) and enabled us to respond efficiently with huge impact per dollar. Our Haitian friends needed to know that they are not forgotten, and thanks to your kindness and sacrifice, we were not only able to help them out right now, but we are able to help them begin to rebuild for a stronger future. Each one of our Monthly Partners are a valuable part of projects such as this and all of the other works that we accomplish through Absolute. Together we are making a difference!

Timeline
On January 15, we arrived in Port-au-Prince to assist the orphanages we support as well as help out with initial emergency response to help dig out survivors and retrieve possessions. We spent five days helping and assessing the best ways we could be of support. Upon our return, we reached out to Absolute supporters to assist in helping those we are connected with in Port-au-Prince, and each of you responded with compassion and generosity.

On February 3, We left for Port-au-prince with the first $10,000 raised for Haiti through Absolute. A truck was filled with $8000 worth of aid in Dominican Republic and brought across the border into Haiti, where it was systematically delivered via a network of volunteers on the ground. Over the next four days, with the help of many caring Haitians and the staff at Kay Papa Nou, we were able to deliver the aid to the orphanages and tent cities across Port-au-Prince that we had previously identified.



 
Delivery of the aid
 Our aid supplies were divided into 4 different places: two different tent towns, the orphanage and a displacement camp. Most of the tent towns we visited had not received any other aid at that point, and we were grateful to be able to supply them and bring encouragement.
 Aid supplies (approximately)
200 cases of water
 400 packs of rice
 400 bottles of oil
 400 bags of beans
 600 bars of soap
 1000 packs of soup mix
 900 roles of toilet paper
 1000 packs of cookies and crackers
6 cases of milk
600 packs of pasta
400 small bags of detergent
300 cans of sardines
900 bags of corn mix
Large tarps
tents
6 Large boxes of medical supplies. (donated by Servant&apos;s Heart Ministries)
4 boxes of clothes (donated by Servant&apos;s Heart Ministries)
500 candles
1 - 2200 Honda generator
Other Expenses

$1600 went to pay for orphanage staff, vehicle maintenance, baby supplies and orphanage bills
$400 went to pay translators, travel expenses, border fees, and other misc. items needed for this project


 However, this is about more than numbers or lists; this is about real lives with real need being met with compassion and kindness - your donation made that possible. To hear some of the stories of he aid that was delivered, check out our 52 Blog at http://52.absolute.org/2010/02/14/never-forgotten/ .

Absolute is now preparing for our May Live Different Build in Haiti. We will be working with participants on the boys&apos; home within Kay Papa Nou orphanage installing doors, building a kitchen and replacing a roof on the children&apos;s school. We will also be helping to continue to help them reach more orphans and families that they are currently identifying through their volunteer network.

Again, thanks for your generous response and in your faith in us to deliver it with effectiveness. Your gift made a difference and your life makes a difference every day!
