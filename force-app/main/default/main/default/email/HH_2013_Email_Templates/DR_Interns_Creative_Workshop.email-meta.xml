    <textOnly>Hello Summer Interns!

We are just finalizing activities and plans for your intern week.

One of the days during your intern week, you guys will be paired up to run different creative workshops for the community of Arroyo Seco.

What this means is that you will be paired up to run workshops at the community centre for 80 kids. The workshops will be based on different creative talents.

Here are some things we would love you to bring down for the workshop, please respond to me by next Wednesday what materials you are able to bring down:

Crayons
Coloured pens/felts/pencils
Colouring books
Face paint and brushes
Face wipes to get the paint off
Play dough
Any arts and crafts things like pipe cleaners etc.
Skipping ropes
Soccer balls and pumps
Anything you guys would like to bring for the Creative Workshop Day!

This is the first summer we are doing this, so be creative because everything you bring down will be what you use to run your workshop.</textOnly>
