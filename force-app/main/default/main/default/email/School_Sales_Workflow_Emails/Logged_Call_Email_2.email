                <p>Hi {!recipient.FirstName},</p>
                <p>I hope you're having a wonderful week!</p>
                <p>It's evident that students today are dealing with heightened challenges, including increased instances of depression, addiction, and feelings of disconnection, all amplified by the pandemic's impact.</p>
                <p>If you're looking for additional ways to support your students, our Assemblies at LiveDifferent are designed to inspire self-belief, enhance resilience, and impart a lasting positive effect.</p>
                <p>Bringing our program to {!recipient.Account.Account_Nickname__c} could truly make a significant difference this year.</p>
                <p><strong>An educator from Saskatchewan shared this insightful feedback:</strong></p>
                <p style="color: #0b5394;"><em>"Engaging teens is a complex task, yet LiveDifferent nails it! Their unique approach in presentations effectively conveys a message of resilience and hope - it's simply phenomenal!"</em></p>
                <p>Iâ€™ve attached our <strong>23/24 Circles Programming PDF</strong> to learn more about what our Assembly theme and our 2 FREE Follow Up Workshops are all about.</p>
