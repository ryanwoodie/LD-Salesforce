    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope that things are well for you in {!Contact.MailingCity}! At Absolute we have been deeply impacted by the earthquake in Haiti, having many friends there that we have made during our humanitarian trips. We feel that we have a unique idea to create help for Haiti, using our popular Think Day motivational presentation to create a chain of benefit assemblies for the month of February in Ontario. I am contacting you to see if you might be interested in helping start this Chain Reaction of Hope in your area.

This campaign is an opportunity for many lives to be affected in positive way. Please read the information below, and let me know what you think. You can call me at 1-866-432-4464, or reply to this email. Thanks for you time {!Contact.FirstName}. I hope to hear from you!

Let&apos;s make a difference together,

*********
Hope for Haiti. Hope for another school. Hope for your school. All at the same time.


Your school can start a chain-reaction of hope for Haitians! By giving 1 hour of your school&apos;s time for a motivational benefit assembly you will be making a life-changing difference in 3 places: in Haiti, in your school, and in another school of your choice!
 

 Here is how it works:
 To start the chain, Absolute will contribute our Think Day assembly free of charge to your school. What you might normally pay for such a presentation is instead used in a 100% charitable cause: 

50% or more (depending on size of donation) to help the Haitian people in an incredibly direct and tangible way (read about it here). If you have another charity that you would prefer to give money for Haiti to, we will still work with you!

50% to &quot;pay it forward&quot;, relaying the impactful presentation to the next school (that you choose), thereby continuing the chain reaction.

(You might also consider using this event in combination with, or to spearhead or wind up a school fundraising campaign! More fundraising will create a higher percentage of money for Haiti (as our touring costs will remain fixed).)

Check our website to see how far your chain goes, and how much it raises!


 
 Why you should participate:

 Absolute&apos;s Think Day is Canada&apos;s leading motivational presentation and is unrivaled in relevancy and effectiveness. It features a live band, inspirational media, and motivational speakers in a concert level production. In addition to all the good that is being generated for Haiti, there will be a powerful message of hope and purpose for your students, and for the school that you pay it forward to.

Grass-roots efficiency. Money for Haiti goes directly to very tangible needs and effective projects - not to the potential bureaucracy of a large NGO. We will provide your school with direct reports and updates on how the money is being used for good, and will answer any question you have on it!

A simple and practical way for your school to feel that they are making a strategic response to one of the worst tragedies of our time.

Snowball Effect. Relaying this campaign to the next school, your school can track how much good is happening down the line!

Exponential Philanthropy! This is creating good for Haiti by doing something good for schools in your community. You can feel great about investing your school&apos;s money or fundraising efforts to make a difference in 3 ways at once!

 
Why is Absolute doing this?
 Absolute has been working alongside Haitians for over 5 years in our humanitarian work . Our hearts go out to many Haitian friends that have experienced unspeakable loss. We have seen the devastation ourselves, having volunteers on the ground within 2 days of the earthquake. It is worse than the media can even convey. This is our humble attempt to do what we can, with the resources we have (ie. a great motivational presentation), to help the people we love, in a way that is actually going to get to them. We challenge you to join with us to start a Chain Reaction of Hope!
