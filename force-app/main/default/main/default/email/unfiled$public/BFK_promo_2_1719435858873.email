  <p>Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>
  <p>I wanted to send a friendly reminder about the Rogers Birdies for Kids campaign, where every dollar donated is matched up to 50%. Your generous support will directly impact LiveDifferent's mental wellness programming for youth in Alberta through our Circles program. To date, LiveDifferent has visited 502 schools in Alberta, reaching 196,100+ youth!</p>
  <p>Through engaging assemblies, workshops, and leadership training, LiveDifferent Circles helps young people explore values, build strong relationships, and foster kindness, leaving them more compassionate, resilient and hopeful. It costs $5,000 a day to deliver the Circles program, and your donation will help us increase subsidies to reach even more students.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I want to share a quote from a student we reached this year:</p>
  <p><span style="color:rgb(67, 67, 67);"><em>"You helped my mental illness now I can keep my head high and smile... no one has ever helped me with that, I'll one day join this program"&nbsp;</em> </span></p>
  <p>Please consider making a donation today and help us support the youth in your community. Your donation will enter you for a chance to win one roundtrip flight for two guests wherever WestJet flies!</p>
