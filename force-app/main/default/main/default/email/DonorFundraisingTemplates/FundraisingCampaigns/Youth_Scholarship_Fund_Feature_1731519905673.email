<p>Hi ,</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for letting us feature you!</strong> We are so grateful that you’ve responded to Tyler's email and are willing to share your story. Your contribution will help inspire others and make a lasting impact.</p>

<p>Some of your content may be featured on our LiveDifferent Facebook page, Instagram, website, and in our email newsletters. It’s a wonderful opportunity to inspire others and celebrate the lasting impact of your experience!</p>

<p>The campaign we’ll be running this December will help expand our <strong>Youth Scholarship Fund</strong>, which each of you have been a recipient of. We created this fund a couple of years ago, and thanks to the support of our generous donors, we were able to send 11 youth to the Dominican Republic and Mexico last year.</p>
