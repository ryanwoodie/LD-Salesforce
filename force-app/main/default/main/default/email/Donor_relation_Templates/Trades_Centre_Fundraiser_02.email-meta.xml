Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We&apos;re so excited to share that thanks to generous donors just like you, we&apos;ve already raised $7,900 for the Trades Learning Centre! That means we&apos;re beyond the halfway point of making this project a reality!

We&apos;re extremely grateful for the support that has already been invested in this project, but also know that there is still a significant amount that needs to be raised in order to complete it.

That&apos;s where you come in! You&apos;ve visited the local communities in Mexico, met the families, and seen the renewed sense of confidence and pride when people are able to lift themselves out of poverty. The Trades Learning Centre will extend this upward momentum, helping families improve their livelihoods by empowering them with the skills necessary to find meaningful and sustainable work.

Will you help us reach our $15,000 goal by fundraising to build the Trades Learning Centre that will impact the lives of many local families?
