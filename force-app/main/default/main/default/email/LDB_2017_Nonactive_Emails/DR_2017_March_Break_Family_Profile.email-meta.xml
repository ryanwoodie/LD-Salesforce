    <textOnly>Hey everyone,

Here is the family profile for the family you will be building for: http://livedifferent.com/projects/cecilia-and-pedro/

Donations:
We have a lot of donated items from previous Live Different Builds, so the best thing to do is to make a donation either by calling our office (1-866-432-4464) or through your Fundraising Page. These funds will then go to our Community Development Fund and will allow us to help the communities that we work in even when there are no groups there building. This also allows us to purchase items that are needed and to support the Dominican economy.

If you really feel that you want to bring down some donation items, the best items to bring are:

Hygiene items (toothbrushes, toothpaste, soaps, hair brushes, etc.)
School supplies (pens, pencils, notebooks, etc.)
Household items (towels, bed sheets, table cloths, cutlery, cooking utensils, etc.)

Please be sure that all donated items that are brought down are new, and not used, and fit into your personal luggage.

Email me if you have any questions!</textOnly>
