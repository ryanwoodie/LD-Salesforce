    <subject>Haiti May Trip - Facebook Group</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello everyone!



Only a few more months left until you are meeting all the beautiful faces of the little ones in Haiti.



We have a facebook group created for all of you lovely volunteers. It will be a great way for everyone to ask questions before the trip starts and coordinate flights. Also, a few days before the trip start date, I will let you know that you can add your family members so we can post updates in the group for them to see.



For now, please add yourself into the group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/199240567225043/



Post a little introduction of who you are, where you are from and what you are the most excited about for the trip.



I can&apos;t wait to chat! Hope this helps with communication before and during the trip. If you have questions let me know.
