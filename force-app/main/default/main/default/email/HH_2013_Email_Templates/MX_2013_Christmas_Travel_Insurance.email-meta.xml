    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Hope you had an awesome weekend!

Could you please provide me with the following information about your Travel Medical Insurance:

Travel Insurance Provider:
Policy #:
Policy Name (if applicable):
Policy Phone #1:
Policy Phone #2:

If you do not have any Travel Medical Insurance coverage through your parents, school, or work, than you can purchase this online.

Here is a great website to compare prices: http://www.insuremytrip.com

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

See you soon!</textOnly>
