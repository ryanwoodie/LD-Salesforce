    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!



I am so excited to inform everyone that we have 17 people now signed up for our trip to Haiti so that means the trip is a sure thing. Please start booking your flights!!!!!


Booking your flights:

If  you haven&apos;t already checked out your trip page, please do so this week  so you can become familiar with our trip itinerary and when it is time to book flights, please book them to Puerto Plata, DR: http://livedifferent.com/hero-holiday/trips/public-trip-ht-2014http://livedifferent.com/hero-holiday/trips/christmas-public-trip

Airport: Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic - Airport Code: POP
Arrival: May 9, 2014
Departure: May 18, 2014

Upon Arrival:
All volunteers fly into the Puerto Plata Airport (POP) and our staff will pick them up and we will drive them to the resort.



Pick up and drop off:
Once you have booked your flights, please forward me your trip itinerary and I can add you to our bus shuttle. When you arrive at the Puerto Plata Airport, our staff will be at the gate wearing a Live Different t-shirt and holding a Live Different sign, and you will then be taken to Sosua by the Sea Resort in Sosua (10 minutes away from the airport).

After we drop off the volunteers at the airport on their last day, they get on their flight and they&apos;re on their own from there on. All the volunteers can be picked up on the other side by their parents or other family members.



Accommodations:
We stay at a small and clean resort called Sosua  by the Sea while in Dominican Republic. It is located 10 minutes away from the Puerto Plata Airport  in a town called Sosua. While in Haiti, we stay at a resort called Royal Residence. It is located 10 minutes away from our school build up in a small town called Calvaire in the city of Cap Haitien. The rooms provided at both accommodations can fit up to 4 people  in a room with 2-3 beds. There is a private pool (DR and HT) and beach (DR only) that is  accessible for all volunteers. There is a buffet-style dining hall that  we are able to transform into an event hall for all of our evening  activities. The hotel has security guards that monitor the resort at all  times to ensure our safety. Shower towels, beach towels, a safe with a  key, and bedding are all provided by the resort.



Transportation:
We hire bus drivers for transportation and they arrive every morning at the resort to take us to the communities we will be working in. The drivers are experienced drivers whom we have been working with since 2005, they have experience driving in Dominican Republic and Haiti, as well as the legal documents to drive these registered  vehicles.



Communities We Work In:

Since 2010, we have developed very strong  relationships with the community of Calvaire that we work in. The community knows  Live Different very well and we feel very safe at all times while  working on our building sites.



Work Site Safety:
We require all volunteers to bring down closed toed shoes, a hat/bandana, waterbottle, sunglasses, sunscreen, and leather work gloves. This ensures that volunteers are as equipped for handling equipment on the job sites.



Vaccinations and Medications:
We do not require that any of our volunteers receive any vaccinations or medications to go to any of the countries that we work in. But, we do suggest that every volunteer visit their family doctor or local medical clinic and decide on your own about taking any medications or vaccinations prior to the trip.



Excursion Day (trip specific):
There are a few options for the excursion day that our staff will decide on closer to the date of the trip. Our staff will be with the group that will be going on an excursion. If volunteers do not want to sign up for an excursion, they are welcome to stay back at the resort with our staff members.



Contact during a trip between volunteers and Canada:
There is wifi available at the resort, a wifi code can be purchased at the front desk. Due to the fact that we will be using internet in a developing country, it will be hard for volunteers to receive a well enough connection skype with their family members, but they can indeed use Facebook and e-mail. We also have a Facebook page that we update every day to keep family and friends informed. All of our  staff have cell phones on them at all times.We will be emailing everyone all of the emergency contact information before the trip starts.
