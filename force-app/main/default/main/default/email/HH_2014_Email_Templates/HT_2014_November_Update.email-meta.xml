    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!



I am very excited to inform you that we have 12 volunteers signed up for the trip now. We only need 3 more people to sign up before you can start booking your flights.



A good way to spread the word is to post the Haiti video to your facebook or email the video out to your friends and family!



Here is a video link about our Haiti trip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cC7_iEk97I



Here is a quick reminder:

Please do not book any flights until we have confirmed that the trip is happening.
This trip is conditional and we need 15 people to register by depositing $300 to make this trip happen.


Fundraising:

Use your Canada Helps Page for making, entering and requesting donations or payments related to your trip. You can share (email, Facebook, etc.) your Canada Helps Page with any potential donors so they can donate online to your Live Different Build project (to help meet your fundraising goal).
If you start fundraising and people are giving you donations, they are 100% non-refundable. If the trip is cancelled due to a lack of interest, it can be used as a fundraising goal for another Live Different Build trip (of your choice).

Please e-mail me back with more questions or concerns you may have. I look forward to answering them for you!



Sincerely,



Joy Yu</textOnly>
