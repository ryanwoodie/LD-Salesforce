    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName}!


I am so excited to inform you that you have been officially accepted into our Summer Internship Program. There is so much potential in you at such a young age to inspire change in the youth that will be on our trips. We know that you will be a great asset to our team this summer and get along great with the other interns we have accepted. Welcome to the Live Different Internship Team!

You will be headed to Mexico!

The next steps:

1. Facebook Page
If everyone can add me to Facebook, I can then add you to our Facebook group so you can meet everyone else!

This is my facebook book: https://www.facebook.com/joyyu27

2. $300 Deposit
Please make your initial $300 deposit for the internship by setting up Canada Helps page, use the attached PDF file to follow the directions. This is also available on the Internship page where you registered!

3. Book Your Flights!

If you haven&apos;t already checked out your trip page, please do so this week so you can become familiar with our trip itinerary and start booking your flights.

Airport: San Diego, CA - Airport Code: SAN
Arrival: August 5th, 2014
Departure: August 30th, 2014

4. Your First Assignment

All assignments are mandatory and must be completed by the deadline.

For every day that your assignment is late there will be something called an &quot;embarrassing moment&quot;. Now, if you have ever been on a Live Different Build with me, you will know that this I do not tolerate tardiness. When you decide to be late for anything, it means you are valuing your own time as being more valuable than everyone else&apos;s.

Things that I have done in the past as punishment, now for some of you guys, you will actually enjoy this:
- Perform an exotic dance (this can occur any time in the day or at the talent show)
- Perform a boy band or girl band song
- Wear whatever we want you to wear for a day
- Go out on airport shuttle runs wearing tight and bright clothing
- Do a belly flop in the water or cement mix/mud
- Whatever the team wants you to do

So if I feel like you are enjoying it a little too much then you will be assigned some cleaning duties (ie. scrubbing the outhouse).

#1: Understanding Your Country

Due date: February 28th

In this assignment I don&apos;t want you guys to have to write an essay, because let&apos;s face it, who enjoys writing forever and ever with proper grammar and sentence structure? This isn&apos;t university! It&apos;s a Live Different Internship! Also, no power points please, we have found that this can take too long to absorb. (Sorry to all the smarties out there!)

The main goal for you as Interns throughout this assignment, is to become a knowledgeable leader. You will be hit with a million questions a day from many volunteers on your trip. As Live Different representatives, we pride ourselves as knowing the facts. We do not want to &quot;pretend&quot; to know our stuff. We also don&apos;t want to integrate into a culture without knowing the basics first.

I would like everyone to either read, look up, watch different resources through social media and online search engines. If you would have access, go into your local library and rent some books. I would like everyone to do something very creative to introduce the country you will be working in. I want you to think of me as a volunteer who has never stepped foot outside of Canada before and educate me, but don&apos;t bore me.

Please include the following:
- History (why are we working in this country, why does poverty exist?)
- Clothing (how do they dress, has a lot to do with climate plus cultural beliefs)
- Religion &amp; Culture (main religion and other religions)
- Language(s)
- Import and Export(s)
- Tourism
- Government
- Military &amp; Police
- Economy
- Education (how does the school system work? funded by government, private? half days, full days?)
- Job Opportunities (what are the main jobs in Sosua, Puerto Plata in DR / Zapata, Vicente Guerrero in MX)
- Different tribes or people that live in the country (ie. Haitian refugees in DR / Wahakan tribe in MX)
- Socialization, Etiquette, Arts, Sports, and other important information that you would love to learn more about would be amazing!

Get creative, here are some ideas:
- A very fun artsy chart!
- A creative timeline using point form, years and pictures/photos
- A power point presentation
- A video of yourself with/without friends explaining things in a fun way
- A poster with lots of fun stuff!

I know that this doesn&apos;t give you a lot of &quot;structure&quot;, but this is for everyone to do their own thing and wow me with something that you are AMAZING at. So choose something that you will excel at, whether it&apos;s video making skills, drawing skills, anything!

If you have questions, please ask. The sooner you start this, the better! Please don&apos;t cram it all in on the last date.
