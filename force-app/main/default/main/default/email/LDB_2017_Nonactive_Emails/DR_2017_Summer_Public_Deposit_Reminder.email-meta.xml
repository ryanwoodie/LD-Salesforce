    <textOnly>Happy Spring Season!!!



I can&apos;t believe our winter has come and gone. We are really excited for the Dominican Republic trip this July and are so proud of each and every one of you that have decided to embark on this journey with us. There will be families this summer receiving a house because of your dedication and compassion to love others.



Here are a few reminder items for the next few days:


Facebook Page:

Please add yourself to our private facebook page made for just your specific trip. You can get to know who the other volunteers are before your trip starts!

https://www.facebook.com/groups/233520863786273/

Deposit:

Your $300 deposit can be applied to your fundraising page to secure your spot this summer.

Please let me know if you need assistance in setting up your fundraising page.

Booking your flights:

Airport: Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic - Airport Code: POP
Arrival: July 8th, 2017
Departure: July 17th, 2017


There is a cheaper Westjet flight on July 7th and returning home July 18th. Some of the volunteers as well as myself will be on the Toronto to Puerto Plata flight on those dates if you would like to fly with us. It is $42 USD per extra night at the hotel if you choose to come a day early and stay a day later. Remember, the trip doesn&apos;t start until the 8th, so the extra days will be your own time for vacation. The price includes all three meals and a night stay at the hotel.

Please let me know if you have any questions, I would love to chat!
