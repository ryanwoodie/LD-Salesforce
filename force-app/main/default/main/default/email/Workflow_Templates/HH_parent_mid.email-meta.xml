Hello again!

While you are reading this, we are busy experiencing Live Different Build and realizing how each of us can play a part in making the world a better place! We hope that you are following along with our Facebook updates, student blog posts, and personal emails.

Your son or daughter is currently in the middle of a life-changing experience - one that is shifting their perspective today and helping them to see the possibilities for the future. They may be facing moments of reality that few people are ever given the opportunity to know: realizing the full impact of what poverty can look like, learning how to have grace and understanding for a culture different from their own, as well as making incredible connections and memories with new friends and long time peers. It is life to the limits!

During this time, they may also be experiencing a wide range of emotions as they begin to understand what life is like for two-thirds of our world: shock, guilt, frustration, judgment on their own culture - and hopefully - resolution and understanding about ways that they can return home and begin to make a difference where they are at. On their final day with us, we will be holding a special debriefing session for our volunteers, encouraging and equipping them with how to return home and make the most of this experience. Live Different Build is meant to be a catalyst in their lives - an opportunity to open them up to the possibilities that surround them wherever they are.

Thanks again for helping to provide this opportunity for them. You have done a great job raising them, as they are a reflection of who you are and what you have instilled in them. Anyone who chooses to be a part of an experience such as this is a very special and compassionate person, full of incredible potential, and we are honored to have them be a part of our Live Different Build experience.

As we have already said, we are here for you if you need anything or have any questions regarding their time with us.

Thanks again for being such a great parent and cheerleader!

Sincerely,

The Live Different Team
