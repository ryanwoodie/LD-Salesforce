<p>PS. Here's what one student had to say about their Builds experience:</p>
<p><em style="color: #1c4587;">“Coming back from Mexico, I just felt like I blossomed. One of the reasons I’m most thankful for my LiveDifferent [Builds] is because it’s really allowed me to be myself and to have confidence in who I am.”</em></p>
