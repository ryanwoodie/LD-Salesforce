<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}!<br />
<br />
I hope that the fall has been off to a great start for you! I am reaching out to our “Educator Consultants” list that we occasionally email to get advice on important questions or ideas.<br />
<br />
We have some exciting news—we just launched our <a href="http://livedifferent.com/app">LiveDifferent: Digital Kindness Coach</a> app. &nbsp;The app is designed to engage students and groups in learning, taking action and growing in a lifestyle of compassion.<br />
<br />
<b>We are looking for some early adopters that would like to run a Group </b>in the app with students. This could be a student leadership group, classroom, sports team, club, etc. You can choose specific sets of “challenges” to assign to the group, and students can encourage each other as they complete these different acts of learning, connection and kindness together. &nbsp;Schools can even have multiple groups or classrooms that are working (or competing) toward the same goal together.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We will work with group managers to tailor or organize challenges that meet specific goals or learning outcomes for a group, classroom or school. Your experience and feedback will greatly help shape the ongoing development of the LD app.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:20px;">You can download the app here: <a href="https://livedifferent.com/app">http://livedifferent.com/app</a> </span><br />
<br />
If you are interested in starting or learning more about a Group, feel free to reply to this email or <a href="https://calendly.com/livediff-rw/ryan">book a short call on my calendar</a> !<br />
<br />
With Kindness,<br />

PS. Incase you are interested in a quick update regarding our school presentations/programming—our new Circles online assemblies and peer mentorship program have been really successful and having an incredible impact! &nbsp;Here is some feedback that we recently captured: <a href="https://youtu.be/yYUKsC6q_5A">https://youtu.be/yYUKsC6q_5A</a><br />
