Our work in Haiti has just received a significant boost as a result of the With Love Gala that happened on October 4th, and we just had to let you know before we make an official announcement on our social channels!

At the event, we heard stories of resiliency and meaningful change, connected with other like-minded individuals, and shared our dreams for the future—which involved our plans to provide better futures for girls affected by human trafficking in Haiti through our Freedom Village.

In total, we raised $653,900 towards the construction of our Freedom Village (and over $1.25M total, with the rest of those funds going towards our work right here in Canada).

We recently were able to break ground on the Freedom Village as a result of the funds raised from last year’s gala and now, thanks to the success of this year’s With Love Gala, we are getting closer having all of the construction costs being fully fundraised!

THANK YOU!

Thank you for your continued support towards the children at Ecole L’Union. Your gift is continuing to provide much-needed education for a child in the community of Calvaire and is contributing greatly to the change that is happening in the area! In the next few years, the school will have new neighbours, as girls rescued from exploitation will be calling the Freedom Village home. We are incredibly grateful for all of it!
