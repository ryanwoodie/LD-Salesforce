<p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>

<p>Hope your week is sunny and warm! 🤙</p>

<p>Did you know we&#39;ve built over 600 homes for families in need? 🏠✨</p>

<p>You could be a game-changer, building homes and lives. And it&#39;ll change your life too!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what Emily, a Build Volunteer, had to say:</p>

<blockquote><em>&quot;The people that I have met and the experiences I have had during these Builds have changed my entire outlook on life.&quot;</em></blockquote>

<p>Would you be interested in joining us on a Build?</p>

<p>Stay curious,</p>

<p>Tyler</p>
