Hello again!

For some of you, it&apos;s been a long time since you&apos;ve heard from Live Different, while others may have just joined us on a trip this year. Either way, we&apos;re really excited to announce a new kind of trip designed specifically with YOU in mind - an Alumni Build Trip for returning volunteers!

(If you&apos;re wondering what a &apos;Build Trip&apos; is, we&apos;ve changed the name of our Hero Holiday program to Live Different Builds - for more info on the name change,  check out this blog!)

Not only will our Alumni Build Trip give you the opportunity to be a part of hope and change all over again, but this time around, the trip is longer, (a full two weeks!), and you&apos;ll be working on building projects in TWO of our destination countries - Dominican Republic and Haiti!

This trip is a great chance for you and the friends you&apos;ve made on past trips to return together, to help those in need in a tangible way, and to be reminded that life really is about people, not stuff.

Spots are limited, so sign up now for what we know will be another life-changing trip!

Sincerely,

The Live Different Team




Wondering how to fundraise?
See videos from Haiti and Dominican Republic!

A great way to fundraise is to get together with other alumni you&apos;ve met on past trips and raise funds together!

Find ideas here!


See some of the recent projects we&apos;ve completed in the countries you&apos;ll be working in.
