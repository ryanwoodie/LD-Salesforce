  Happy Monday, Jane, and thanks for the response! 
  <br /> 
  <br /> When we officially launch &quot;Live Different Circles&quot; later this week, you'll receive details about how we can custom tailor this program to suit the needs of your school and students, whether it be in the classroom or online from home. We've been testing out this programming online with Canadian students and teachers over the past few months with really great results and we are so excited for this new opportunity to mentor and impact so many young people, especially during this challenging season we find ourselves in. 
  <br /> 
  <br /> We completely understand your hesitancy to commit to anything for next year just yet though, and we're more than happy to pick this conversation up again in the Fall. 
  <br /> 
  <br /> Have a great summer! 
  <br />
