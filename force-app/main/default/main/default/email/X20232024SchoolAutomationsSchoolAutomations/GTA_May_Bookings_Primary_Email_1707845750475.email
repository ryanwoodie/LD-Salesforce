<p>Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}</p>

<p>I hope this message finds you well! As I am sure you are aware May is Mental Health Month.</p>

<p><strong>Mental Health Month </strong>is an opportunity to educate students about the importance of their own mental health. LiveDifferent’s road teams are taking part in this important initiative throughout schools all over Canada. We provide Assemblies and workshops that focus on mental wellness through storytelling and interactive activities, offering tools that students can carry with them after we leave.</p>

<p>We’ve already been receiving rave reviews from educators. This year, <u>91% of surveyed educators</u> rated our assembly as "better than most" or "the best they’ve seen" — a testament to the impact we're having in schools nationwide!</p>

<p>Our assembly theme this year is:</p>

<p>"<strong>The power of possibility; building hope and resilience through self-belief</strong><strong>"&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>LiveDifferent will be travelling back through Ontario in May, and we still have a few dates available from <strong>May 21 - 31st, 2024.</strong></p>
