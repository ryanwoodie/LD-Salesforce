    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

At some point over the past year, either through contact with our Live Different teams in your school, or in communication with our office staff, you expressed interest in being a Live Different Consultant.

We are currently putting together our programming for the 2015/2016 school year, and would love to have your input on what sort of issues and initiatives would be the most relevant to your students. Please click on the button below to be taken to a short questionnaire.

Thank you for your willingness to provide extra advice, feedback, and ideas that will help improve the charitable student empowerment work that Live Different does!



Take me to the questionnaire!
