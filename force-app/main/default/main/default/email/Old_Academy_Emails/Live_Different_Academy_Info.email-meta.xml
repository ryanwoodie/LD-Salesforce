    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for filling out our Stay Involved Card at the end of your trip to let us know about the ways you&apos;d like to get involved here at Live Different!

You noted that you were interested in our Live Different Academy! If you&apos;ll be graduating this year, you can apply for our fall session, but if that&apos;s too soon for you, let us know, and we can get you information on our applying in the future!

Destination: Mexico
Dates: September 13th - December 12th, 2015

During your time as an Academy student, you&apos;ll experience leadership development classes, a social justice course, and personal learning experiences. You&apos;ll also be able to learn Spanish, build a home for a family, volunteer in the community, and spend &apos;A Week-in-the-Life&apos; of a Mexican migrant worker - learning first-hand about the struggles, and the joys, of what life is like for many who live in the communities we serve. All of these aspects are focused on helping you to see the part you play in changing and shaping the world - a realization that will change you for the rest of your life!
