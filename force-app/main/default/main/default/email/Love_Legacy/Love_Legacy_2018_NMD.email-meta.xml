    <subject>Exciting news about the #Love Legacy nutrition program.</subject>
    <textOnly>We are super excited to announce a big change for the students and staff of Ecole L&apos;Union!

#NoMoreDays

We started our nutrition program with the ability to serve lunch one day each week. In those early days, the school administration would shuffle which day lunch would be served in order to maximize attendance numbers throughout the week; a sad reality of how badly these children needed nutritious meals.

We have been slowly adding meals over the last year and are thrilled to let everyone know that, starting in April, the children at Ecole Lâ€™Union are enjoying a nutritious lunch each and every school day. This is all thanks to the generous one time donations and, of course, our #LoveLegacy sponsors like yourself.

Each day, minds and tummies are being filled. Now that is something to celebrate!
