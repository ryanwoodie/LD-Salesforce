                                <p>Hello again.</p>
<p>As promised, I wanted to share some great ideas with you this week and I am excited to introduce you to our Hope For the Holidays Campaign! </p>
<p>This past year, Live Different's Live Different Build volunteers accomplished many amazing things! Together, we built number houses in Dominican Republic and Mexico, ensured that number Haitian children are now being educated (for the first time) through our school in Cap Haitian and that number children in northern Thailand are living out freedom through our partner projects. </p>
<p>This Holiday Season, we want to accomplish something special that would send a message of love and hope to those communities. For each family we have built a home for, we are providing a "Christmas Hamper" of supplies such as groceries and basic household items. We are also providing holiday parties that include a hot meal for our students in Haiti and the children in our partner program in Thailand.</p>
<p style='font-size:14px;font-weight:bold'>But there is more! </p>
<p>We have set our fundraising goal at $30,000 because, like you, we believe in building for the future and reaching out to the communities we have all worked in. You could say that our goal this holiday season is Hampers and Houses. </p>
<p>To do this, we need your help! You indicated that you would be interested in helping us fundraise for future projects, and we promised to do our best to find projects worth your efforts. We believe we can accomplish this together, if we are each willing to do our part to help out.</p>

<p>Together, this goal is attainable! Here is how you can help to make our combined efforts a success: </p>
<p>Would you be willing to create a fundraising page (through CanadaHelps), just like Cindy's?<img src='http://livedifferent.com/sites/default/files/campaigns/hoh_2012/cindypage.jpg' align='right' /></p> 
<p>On your personalized page you can share your goal and make it known to your friends and family that you are a part of something this year that will make life much brighter for years to come. We are not just asking you to give money - we are asking you to join with us to raise the money needed to make this Holiday of Hope possible. Holidays such as this are traditionally celebrated with gift giving. Perhaps this year you would like to give a 'gift' of a Hamper to your Mom. Or maybe you want your Mom to donate, as her gift to you, towards your CanadaHelps page.</p>

<p>Want to join our fundraising community and reach out through your network of friends and family to spread the love this holiday season? If so, please email us and let us know that you have set up a Holidays of Hope page through CanadaHelps or to ask us any more questions.</p>

<p>Together we can touch our world this holiday season through the power of love, hope and change.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you!</p>
