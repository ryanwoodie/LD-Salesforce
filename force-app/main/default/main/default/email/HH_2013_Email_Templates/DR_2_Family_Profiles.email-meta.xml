    <textOnly>Hey everyone!

If you haven&apos;t already been an eager beaver and checked out the projects link on your trip page, than please click the following link:

http://livedifferent.com/hero-holiday/trips/public-trip-2-dr-2013

The 3 families we will be building for are under &quot;projects&quot;. Please let me know if you have any questions.

As of right now, we have not decided who will be on which team, or have we decided which family anyone is specifically building for.

We will let you know closer to the date.

Thanks!
