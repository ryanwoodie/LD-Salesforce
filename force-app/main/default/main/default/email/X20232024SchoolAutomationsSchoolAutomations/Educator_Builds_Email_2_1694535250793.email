<p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>

<p>I hope your week is going well! Have you had the opportunity to explore the Builds videos or our website? Which destination piques your interest: <a href="https://livedifferent.com/programs/builds/where-we-build/dominican-republic/" style="color: #0000ff;" target="_blank"><strong>Dominican Republic</strong></a> or <a href="https://livedifferent.com/programs/builds/where-we-build/mexico/" style="color: #ff0000;" target="_blank"><strong>Mexico</strong></a>?</p>

<p>Here's a quote from a student who recently participated in a Build:</p>

<p><span style="color: #1c4587;"><em>“Coming back from Mexico, I just felt like I blossomed. One of the reasons I’m most thankful for my LiveDifferent Build is because it’s really allowed me to be myself and to have confidence in who I am.”</em></span></p>

<p>To delve deeper into what a Build could mean for you and your students, let's set up a chat. Click <a href="https://calendly.com/livedifferent/discovery-call" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HERE</a> to find a suitable time in my calendar.</p>

<p>Looking forward to connecting soon!</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
