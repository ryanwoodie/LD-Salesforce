  <p>Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>
  <p>I’m excited to announce that LiveDifferent is participating in the&nbsp;<a href="https://rogerscharityclassic.com/charity/#our-cause" target="_blank"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">Rogers Birdies for Kids campaign</span></a>! The Rogers Charity Classic Foundation matches every dollar donated to LiveDifferent up to 50%, which means your donation will go even further to support our mental wellness programming for youth in Alberta.</p>
  <p>As a bonus, and thanks to our partners at WestJet, every $25 donation you make earns you a chance to win a roundtrip flight for two to any WestJet destination. It's a win-win: support youth and get a shot at a great trip!</p>
  <p>Join us in making a difference.&nbsp;</p>
