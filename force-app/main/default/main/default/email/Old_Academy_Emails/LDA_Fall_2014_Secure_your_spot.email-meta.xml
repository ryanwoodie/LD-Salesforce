    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

This is just a reminder that I have not received your $300 deposit through Canada Helps yet to secure your spot for the Live Different Academy.

The directions to make a Canada Helps Giving Page can be found under the tab on the website that you registered: http://livedifferent.com/academy

If you have any questions in regards to this, please let me know!

Talk to you soon,

Joy</textOnly>
