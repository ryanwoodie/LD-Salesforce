We want you to feel comfortable taking on a leadership role with a large group and we want you to feel as prepared as possible.</div><div style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I've attached all three assignments to this email.
