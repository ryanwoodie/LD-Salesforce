    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

On behalf of everyone here at Live Different I would like to welcome you to the Live Different Academy. It is great to be able to send you this acceptance email and we look forward to meeting you in person and having you with us this coming year as we work together to make a difference in Mexico!

My name is Jennifer, I am the Program Administrator for the Academy, I am very excited to know you will be joining us for this 13 week journey! And, once preparations are done, I am even more excited that you will get to spend 3 months with our Academy Team learning, growing, and serving in communities down in Mexico.



Please take some time to read through this email and the attached documents.  It lays out what your next steps are as we start to count down the days till September :).  If you have any questions, please feel free to get in contact with me at any time!

Once you create your My Live Different Account, you will have access to an Academy fundraising page. You can share (email, Facebook, etc.) this page with any potential donors so they can donate online to your charitable portion of the Academy (to help meet your fundraising goal).

Letter to Donors - For businesses to learn what you will be doing with us if you are asking for donations. Access this in your My Live Different Account

Child Protection Policy - This is for all our Live Different Academy students to read. It is our policy on what is appropriate behaviour when dealing with minors and the steps that we take to protect them. Access this in your My Live Different Account

Child Protection Policy Agreement - Once you have read the Child Protection Policy, please sign the agreement, then scan and email it back to me.  Access this in your My Live Different Account.

Packing List - Suggested packing list if you have no idea what to bring with you!

Criminal Record Check - If you will be 18 years old prior to leaving for Mexico, you will be required to obtain a criminal record check. Please obtain one either through your local police station, or you can ask me to send you an online link.
