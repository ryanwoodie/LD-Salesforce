    <subject>LDA - Meet Emily!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Academy Students!

Thank you to all of you who are working hard to fund raise for the months that you will spend in Mexico working with Live Different! We&apos;re really looking forward to having you along for this awesome experience.

So... you&apos;ve sent in all of your paperwork, paid your deposit and are now well into the fundraising part of this experience. But... you probably still have a lot of questions. How will I cope with being away from home for 14 weeks? What is it like to live with a group of people so closely? What are our living arrangements like?

To help answer these questions for you, let me introduce Emily!
Emily participated in our Academy program in 2012 and is an awesome example of someone whose life was truly impacted after her time in Mexico... I won&apos;t go into too much detail here, I&apos;ll let her share her story with you.

Emily will be contacting each of you individually to set up a phone call. She is available to answer questions and chat about what you can expect. Even if you don&apos;t have any specific questions for her, she will be happy to tell you about her experience.

You will receive an email or phone call from Emily soon, but feel free to contact her directly via email: emily.mccallum6@gmail.com

Any questions related to payments, paperwork, flights and all of the administrative items can still be forwarded to me :)

PS. Have a friend who is interested in joining the Academy program with you? Space is still available!

Have a great week,
Jenn</textOnly>
