  <p style="font-size:22px;font-weight:bold">Hello again!</p>

<p>Another Live Different Build has come and gone. We are thankful for the time that we had with your son or daughter, and we are excited for what is going to happen in the days ahead in them as a result of this experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://livedifferent.com/sites/default/files/email/hh_wf-parpost1.jpg" alt="Live Different Build" align="right" />By now, they have probably shared many of their moments and memories with you about their time with us. Undoubtedly, they have met people that have impacted their lives and people that have changed the way they view life and what they are privileged to have. While this experience was probably a real high for them while they were with us, in the next little while, they may experience the other side of a trip such as this: the crash with reality. There is a natural progression that seems to take place for almost all of our volunteers that have joined us on a Live Different Build, and in case you have never experienced it, we would like to give you some insight into some of the ways they may be trying to process their experience.</p>

<p>Many people, once faced with a life-changing opportunity such as a Live Different Build, experience the following five different emotions in varying levels. At first, when they are with us on the initial trip, they may feel shock. They may ask themselves questions such as, "Why have I never seen this before?" "How could I have been so ignorant of what is happening in the world?" As they begin to get over the shock, a new emotion inevitably begins to creep in: guilt. They may feel guilty for all that they have or for the petty things that they may have realized they have focused on. This is normal, but our goal is not to make people feel guilty with what they have been blessed with. Live Different Build is about recognizing that we can do so much more with what we have. Usually, as they realize this, they are getting ready to come home from their trip, and when they get back to life as they knew it, a whole new emotion can often set in: anger.</p>

<p><img src="http://livedifferent.com/sites/default/files/email/hh_wf-parpost2.jpg" align="left" alt="Live Different Build" />Anger is a deceptive emotion for many of us, but especially for a teenager after an experience such as this. Anger can be in many forms: frustration that no one cares about your experience, judgment on people's choices and lifestyles, and even anger with you, their parents, for not fully understanding what they experienced. Take heart! We have warned them that they may feel this, so you can remind them as you are now in the loop as well. After anger, they may feel a sense of hopelessness. As the memory gains distance from them, they may wonder if anything they are doing is going to make a difference. Can they ever follow through on what they resolved they would do when they were on a Live Different Build?</p>

<p>The answer, obviously, is yes! We have already been encouraging them that they are not alone, and that they are surrounded by people who believe in them and believe that they can continue to make a significant difference wherever they are at. Generally, we find that as long as they are given a little bit of encouragement, this quickly passes, and they can move, somewhat, into a good space. That space is what we called the realization of integration. They can take this experience and look at their lives, recognizing what they are capable of starting today. It can be anything from starting or joining a group in their school, preparing for another Live Different Build, volunteering in their community, and even giving them life direction for career planning.</p>

<p><img src="http://livedifferent.com/sites/default/files/email/hh_wf-parpost3.jpg" align="right" alt="Live Different Build" />After over ten years of Live Different Builds, thousands of volunteers, and numerous conversations with parents, we have realized that one of the most influential people in their lives will be you. You have helped to guide them and direct them this far, and encouragement from you can help them to continue to make the most of this investment in their lives and future.<p>

</p>Thanks for all that you have done and continue to do in their lives and in your support of change. If you would like to ask us anything, we are still here!

<p>Thanks for caring! You have helped to make the difference!</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
