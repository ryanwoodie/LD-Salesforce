It is quickly coming up and I am sure that like the rest of us, you have a lot to prepare for!</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">I wanted to touch base with you and give you some updates on our projects and plans, as well as some preparatory things to take into account.</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Packing:</b></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Thai culture, especially in the area that we are working in, is quite a bit more modest than what some of us are used to. We ask that when we are working at the home we all wear longer shorts and t-shirts. Tank tops are ok if they have wider straps. The children have all come from exploitative situations and we do our best to make them as comfortable as possible.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Please bring both flip flops (you never wear shoes inside a doorway and flip flops will be way less hassle!) and close toe work shoes for the work days. We will have places to leave everything, our driver and van is always on site and there is no worry about losing anything.</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">As for the evenings, we will be going out for dinner every night, either at the hotel or to local restaurants to give you a chance to try the excellent cuisine in the area. I personally dress up for dinner in a casual dress or pants, and bring an outfit for our special night out with the staff that we will do one evening during the second week (be prepared to get your karaoke game on!!)</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Also, please remember that you will need an electrical adapter in order to use any outlets there.</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">In regards to swimming, we have a pool at our hotel and you can rock your bikinis or speedos :) if you want there. However, when we are swimming with the kids we all wear t-shirts and longer shorts. The kids will all be wearing that and it is, again, a comfort level. Even the male workers will be wearing t-shirts with the kids when swimming. And, fyi, swimming at a river with waterfalls with that many kids is a wild time!</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Also, you will each have the opportunity to spend one or more evenings at the home with the kids and experience life there from a different perspective. Again, you don't have to go, but the option is available if you choose it.</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Donations</b><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">If you have donations to bring, we welcome them, but we ask that you check with me first over whether it is worth you possibly paying the extra money to bring it with you on the plane. A better use is also to just collect money, bring it with you, and we will make an opportunity for you to get the supplies or to talk with the team there over what they need at the time. (However, those of you who are working out donations with Alison can talk with her about the details she has arranged).&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Canadian stuff is awesome to bring! We are trying to visit a hill tribe with our team again this year, and it would be nice to bring them some gifts from Canada such as pencils, pictures, t-shirts, etc.</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Schedule</b></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We have updated the schedule to the best of our abilities and it is attached to this email. However, please understand that what we agree with the team ahead of time and the last minute changes that may have to happen due to logistics are just a part of the experience :) Moving and rounding up so many little humans can sometimes not go completely according to plan and Thai culture is very relaxed around the concept of time as we know it. We do our best to plan and then we do our best to be respectful and flexible with them as well.</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Project</b></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We are planning on doing a variety of projects. The mornings will be focused on a creative arts camp and working with the kids to create memory books for themselves (they don't have any written history of themselves or their family, so this is a unique opportunity for them to document and show off their talents and connect to their history and sense of belonging). They also want to create a CD with their music team while we are there and Brett will probably be helping them with that. IF any of you are musical, this could be a great time for you to connect with them in this way as well.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">In the afternoons we will be doing a work project that focuses around helping to put up a new greenhouse on the property. This project is great for two reasons: it will help them to create some sustainable income (they will sell some of it at the local market) and it will help the children learn how to take care of plants and give them an opportunity to have some fresh food for themselves.</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We will also take one day to go to the border and visit the drop in centre there, meet the staff and better understand what they are focused on doing there to help protect vulnerable children and families.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We will have the opportunity to go across to Myanmar when we are there, and the cost is $15 USD for the visa if you choose to go across, visit the markets and join us on a brief tour of the areas that they work in. There is no obligation to go, but it is a great experience.</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Excursions</b></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">As of right now, we are pretty sure that we have confirmed the opportunity to be mahouts for a day at a local elephant sanctuary! For those of us who have done it in the past, it has been a major life moment as we actually sit on the elephants, take them to the river for a bath and have an incredible experience learning about them and their history.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We are working with the sanctuary (which is a local supporter of the home) to give us a deal of around $35-$50 USD (1000-1500 &nbsp;baht) for the morning. I will confirm the price with you as soon as they get back to our staff there.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">M<b>edical Questions</b></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We have access to good hospitals and doctors where we are traveling to and from. However, if you have any concerns, please let me know and I can help find the answers to anything you need to know. We will have a first aid kit with us at all times and our staff are trained in First Aid and CPR.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Exchange</b></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">My personal opinion is that there is no difference between exchanging CAD and USD in Thailand in terms of ease of use. I bring CAD cash with me and exchange it at the airport or local banks with no problems at all.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">There are also local ATM's everywhere if you need more cash. Credit cards are only an option in the city or at department stores, so don't count on being able to use them very much.</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">I am available through my email here&nbsp;<a href="mailto:christal@livedifferent.com" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">christal@livedifferent.com</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions.
