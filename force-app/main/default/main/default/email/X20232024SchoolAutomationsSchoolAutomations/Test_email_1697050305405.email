<p>Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
I've been getting errors on our LiveDifferent Builds registration system with sending automatic emails specifically to your email address, and in the event you receive this email it is because I am troubleshooting. (If you haven't received any updates about your Builds registration yet, that is why).<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ryan Wood<br />
