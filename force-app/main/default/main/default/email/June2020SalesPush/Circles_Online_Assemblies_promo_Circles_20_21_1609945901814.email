<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
I hope you're doing well. Although we've turned the page on 2020, many of the same struggles and frustrations that educators are facing continue, making it difficult to keep students connected, engaged, and inspired.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us help you with that in 2021.<br />
<br />
LiveDifferent's school program, <a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/">Circles</a>, is designed to support educators no matter what their schedule or learning environment constraints might allow, and one of the exciting new aspects for&nbsp;2021 is that <b>we're now offering to lead 1-HOUR&nbsp;</b><a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-assembly/"><b>ONLINE SCHOOL ASSEMBLIES</b></a><b>!</b>&nbsp;Videos, speakers, discussion activities, and opportunities for even more engagement around important conversations. You pick one of the six available topics and&nbsp;we'll handle the rest!<br />
<br />
We've partnered&nbsp;with thousands of schools across Canada and although this year is unique&nbsp;for each one of them, together we're still having&nbsp;a positive impact in the lives of young people.&nbsp; Let's chat about when we can have your online assembly!<br />
<br />
Thanks so much {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;</p>
