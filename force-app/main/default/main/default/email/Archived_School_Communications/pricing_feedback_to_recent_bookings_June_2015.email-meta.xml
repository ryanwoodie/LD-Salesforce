Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

This is Ryan Wood here from Live Different, and I hope that you are looking forward to a wonderful summer break! I am contacting you as you recently went through our booking process and I was hoping you might be willing to give some feedback on our pricing approach. Please note: this does NOT affect any booking/contract you have already made with us for next year, we are just looking for advice on potential changes in the future.

As a charity our purpose is not for profit, but to affect positive development in youth, and so we have always provided our program on a donation basis to make sure that any school, regardless of budget, can access a top-notch presentation for their students. Our multi-media motivational experience is quite large/elaborate, and yearly program expenses average out to about $1500 per school, but our average school donation is under $600. So, we work hard internally to fundraise over $200,000/year to fund the cost gap. To help address the growth and sustainability challenge this creates, we want to explore options with our pricing model and if we can better collaborate with schools to be able to increase the average school donation, but without making our program less accessible, (ie. have our cake and eat it too ;-).

Here is a link to a survey form. If you would be willing to give your input on this form, it would be a great help to us:

We rely heavily on educator feedback to guide our program improvement, and we sincerely thank you for your support and input on this matter.

Kindest Regards,

Ryan Wood
