    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

My name is Jon Peters and I manage the road teams at Live Different. I am reaching out to you as one of our past Build trip alumni, as I want to bring another opportunity to your attention: our Canadian school tours!

We have three teams of young adults (5 to 6 per team) that travel across Canada speaking in middle schools and high schools, empowering students to live a lifestyle of compassion and service. These are one-hour ‘rock show style’ presentations with live music, lights, video screens and personal story-telling (students don&apos;t fall asleep during these assemblies, haha :-)

We have two opportunties available:

1. We are now accepting applications for our spring 2020 tour (Jan 18 to May 22, 2020).

2. We still have room for 1 or 2 last minute additions to our fall 2019 tour (Aug 18 to Dec 13, 2019).

Some info:
- This is a free (volunteer) opportunity. Expenses are covered, including flights to bring you to Hamilton to train and start the tour!
- To apply: click here for a PDF summary/application link: https://bit.ly/2TaVhfY

I would love to answer any questions you might have, please call/text my cell 289-683-4100 anytime, or reply to this email.

Thanks again for all your past contributions, and thank you in advance for considering this opportunity.
