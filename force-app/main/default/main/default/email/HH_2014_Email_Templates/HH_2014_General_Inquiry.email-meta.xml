    <textOnly>Hi _______,



To volunteer with Live Different on any of our Live Different Build trips on your own, you must be over the age of 14. All of the project fees, accommodations, meals and travel costs must be fundraised by every volunteer.



Who: Any volunteer can join a trip! (minimum 14 years of age to sign up without a parent guardian)


What: A trip for groups of volunteers who want to make a difference internationally!


When: All year round you can book a private trip with you and your friends (minimum of 10 people) or we have public trips that anyone can sign up for during the summer and holidays!


Where: Dominican Republic, Mexico, Thailand and Haiti


Why: We are all about choice - the choice to live different.

We believe in the value of each of our lives, and that value is what makes our lives worth living.
