    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope that this email finds you well. This is Ryan Wood here, and I am the Director of Canadian Programs for Live Different. I am reaching out to all our school contacts that partnered with us in 2016/17 to ask for your advice as we plan our 2017/18 school programming. Educator feedback is so critical to helping us better serve schools and improving our impact, and I thank you for your consideration with this short survey.

Here is the survey link:
