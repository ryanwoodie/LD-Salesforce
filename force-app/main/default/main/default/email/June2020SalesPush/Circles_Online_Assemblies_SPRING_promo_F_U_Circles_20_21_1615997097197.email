  <p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}!<br /> <br /> I hope you're having a great week so far.&nbsp; Did you happen to read my message&nbsp;about how students and educators have been benefiting from our new </span><a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Circles</span></a>&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">programming&nbsp;this year? We've been providing everything from engaging online assemblies, multi-week discussion based programming, and even free opportunities for educators to authentically connect with each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>"<span style="color:#555555;">The LiveDifferent Circles (assemblies)&nbsp;are perfect for the current times we live in. The presentations on "Resilience" and "Empathy" were both exactly what our students needed at this point in the year and the format kept them active and engaged.</span><span style="color:#000000;">"</span></i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b>Principal in Saskatchewan</b>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">"<span style="color:#555555;"><i>I got to share my thoughts with my class and I couldn't (have done) that before this assembly. The LiveDifferent assembly is life changing.</i></span>" - <b>Student in Ontario</b></span><br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGaviLF3FO8"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-17 at 11.44.21 AM" src="{[devName:Screen_Shot_20210317_at_114421_AM]}" style="max-width: 697.128px; width: 525px; height: 272.135px;" title="Screen Shot 2021-03-17 at 11.44.21 AM" /></a><br /> <br /> {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;If you could take a minute and have a peak at the programming here, I'd really appreciate it:&nbsp;<a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-assembly/">https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-assembly/</a>&nbsp;It's super&nbsp;versatile and adaptable to any&nbsp;of the&nbsp;challenges 2021 continues to throw&nbsp;our way, and schools&nbsp;have really been enjoying the authenticity being cultivated amongst their staff and students. We can still positively impact the lives of young people during these unique times, so let's&nbsp;chat about what that could look like at your school!&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Thanks so much {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, I look forward to hearing from you soon.</span></p>
