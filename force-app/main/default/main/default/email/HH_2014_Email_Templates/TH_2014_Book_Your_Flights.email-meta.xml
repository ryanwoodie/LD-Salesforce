    <textOnly>Hi Everyone!



I am so excited to announce that our Thailand trip will be officially happening. You can start booking your flights and forwarding them to me once you have your itinerary.



We have 9 spots left for the trip.



Please read over the following to help you prepare for your trip:

Your first $300 of your fundraising goal needs to be made to secure your spot.
Use your Canada Helps Page for making, entering and requesting donations or payments related to your trip. You can share (email, Facebook, etc.) your Canada Helps Page with any potential donors so they can donate online to your Live Different Build project (to help meet your fundraising goal).


Booking your flights:

Airport: Chiang Mai, Thailand - Airport Code:CNX
Arrival: April 29, 2014
Departure: May 11, 2014

Upon Arrival:
All volunteers fly into the Chiang Mai Airport (CNX) and our staff will pick them up and we will drive them to the hotel.



Pick up and drop off:
Once you have booked your flights, please forward me your trip itinerary and I can add you to our bus shuttle. When you arrive at the airport, our staff will be at the gate   wearing a Live Different t-shirt and holding a Live Different sign, and   you will then be taken to the hotel that our group will be staying at.



After we drop off the volunteers at the airport on their last day, they get on their flight and they&apos;re on their own from there on. All the volunteers can be picked up on the other side by   their parents or other family members.



Transportation:
We hire professional drivers for transportation and they arrive every morning at the hotel to take us to the children&apos;s home that we will   be working in. The drivers are experienced drivers whom we have been   working with every year, they have experience driving in Thailand, as well as the legal documents to drive these  registered vehicles.



Work Site Safety:
We require all volunteers to bring down closed toed shoes, a hat/bandana, waterbottle, sunglasses, sunscreen, and leather work gloves. This ensures that volunteers are as equipped for handling equipment on the job sites.



Vaccinations and Medications:
We do not require that any of our volunteers receive any vaccinations or medications to go to any of the countries that we work in. But, we do suggest that every volunteer visit their family doctor or local medical clinic and decide on your own about taking any medications or vaccinations prior to the trip.



Excursion Day (trip specific):
There are a few options for the excursion day that our staff will decide on closer to the date of the trip. Our staff will be with the group that will be going on an excursion. If volunteers do not want to sign up for an excursion, they are welcome to stay back   at the resort with our staff members.



Contact during a trip between volunteers and Canada:
Due to the fact that we will be   using internet in a developing country, it will be hard for volunteers   to receive a well enough connection to skype with their family members, but   they can indeed use Facebook and e-mail. We also have a Facebook page   that we update every day to keep family and friends informed. All of  our staff have cell phones on them at all times.We will be emailing everyone all of the emergency contact information before the trip starts.
