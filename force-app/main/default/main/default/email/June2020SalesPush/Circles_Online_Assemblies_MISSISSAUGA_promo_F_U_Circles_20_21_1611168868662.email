<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope you're doing well and that you received my email about supporting your school this year as you strive to keep students engaged, inspired, and connected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only is our&nbsp;<a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/">Circles</a> programming still available to a few more schools&nbsp;<b>FREE OF CHARGE</b>&nbsp;(due to the generosity of&nbsp;<u>The Community Foundation of Mississauga</u>) but we've added exciting new options for schools needing us to help just a little bit more. Can we lead a <a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-assembly/"><b>1-hour, virtual assembly</b></a> for your school? Would you like us to lead our weekly, virtual sessions to help engage students in meaningful&nbsp;conversations and support their mental&nbsp;health? There are lots of options to choose from, all designed to be effective no matter what the learning environment looks like this year.</p>

<p><b>Effective youth empowerment support.<br />
We'll do all the work.<br />
The cost is covered.</b></p>

<p>During these unique times, we have an opportunity to continue impacting the lives of young people in your community and, together, help your school thrive in 2021. Let me know what you think and if you have any questions at all. I'll be happy to help!</p>

<p>Thanks so much&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}.<br />
