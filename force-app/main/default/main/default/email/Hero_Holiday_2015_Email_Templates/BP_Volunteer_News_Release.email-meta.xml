    <subject>Update from Live Different in the Dominican Republic</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

In the past week, you may have seen news reports regarding a political situation happening right now in the Dominican Republic. There are many articles going around that are stating that undocumented Haitian immigrants living in the Dominican Republic are at risk of deportation.


We understand that those of you who have participated in our programs in the past may want to know if this situation is going to affect the people that you have met and the communities that you have grown to love. We also understand that for those of you who are joining us on a Build Trip in the coming months, you likely will be wanting to know if this will affect your trip.


Here at Live Different, we have been following the situation very closely. Both our leadership team and our staff on the ground in the Dominican Republic have been well aware of the registration requirements for all undocumented residents for many months. In fact, this is just the most recent in a series of issues related to an ongoing immigration process that has been happening in the Dominican Republic for more than 30 years. The reality of the situation is that there is a large number of unregistered people living in the Dominican Republic, including Haitians, but also including many Canadians, Americans, Europeans, etc. While some media outlets are reporting stories that only reflect the negative consequences of these registration requirements, it is important to remember that this is a very complicated, polarizing, and historically-rooted issue. Because of this, we at Live Different know we are not equipped to address this issue ourselves, but what we can do is focus on the safety, dignity, and continued development of the communities we work in.


With that as our focus, we can safely say that none of the Haitian staff that we employ are at risk, as they all have the required documentation to be living in the Dominican Republic legally. In addition, all of the Haitian families that we’ve built homes for in the past either have their documentation already, or are in the process of registering for it, as this is one of the requirements for us to be able to build for them.


For those coming with us on a Live Different Build with the Boston Pizza Foundation this summer, at this time, we do not expect there to be any disruption to that trip. Again, as this is a situation that has been ongoing for many years, and so there should be no greater risk to visitors than at any other time. Furthermore, the area that we will building in is a village that is predominantly made up of Dominican families, and so there should be no reason to believe that there should be any increased risk to our teams in that area.


If you have any further questions, concerns, or even comments about this, please don’t hesitate to contact us, we would love to hear from you! You are also welcome to get in touch with Cheryl Treliving and Michelle Schepel at the Boston Pizza Foundation - schepem@bostonpizza.com



For those who have joined us in the past, we hope to see you again soon, and for those who are volunteering this summer, we’re excited to meet you!


Thanks,
