    <subject>A video review of the Haiti Build from June.</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName}, remember the excitement of summer break? Well, the children of Ecole L’Union are currently enjoying some down time of their own. As a result, things around the school have slowed down as the staff and students recharge for another productive year ahead.

Working with the community to address the educational needs of the children of Calvaire, one thing that came up was the importance of ensuring staff continuity and compensation. Being committed to properly supporting our valued teachers and school staff members, with your help, we make sure that they continue to receive their salaries during the summer months. This allows them to better focus on the students and the year ahead!

Towards the end of June, we had a group head down to do some construction work around the school property. We let everyone know that some of our Live Different staff members would be creating some &quot;Instagram Stories&quot; during their time there in order to give you all a behind-the-scenes look at the school. If you weren’t able to follow along when they went live, we’ve uploaded a video for you to check it all out. Just click the image below to see some recognizable faces, have a peek at the great progress happening each day, and see the volunteers in action!

As we look forward to another incredible school year ahead, we want to thank you so much for your continued support of the children of Ecole L’Union.

Enjoy the last bit of the summer and we’ll be in touch soon!
