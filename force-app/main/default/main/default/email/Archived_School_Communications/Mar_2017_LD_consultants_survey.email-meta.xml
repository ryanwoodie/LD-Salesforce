    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope that 2017 has been going well for you so far! It&apos;s been a while since I have been in touch (it has been a busy year as we have launched a 3rd road team, focused on serving Indigenous communities). I am reaching out to you as you are on our list of educators who are willing to be a Live Different Consultant. We are looking for your advice as we plan our 2017/18 school programming. Over the past 3 years, our teacher consultants have provided ideas and advice that has resulted in important improvements to our program. Thank you so much for your continued help; you are making a real difference in students&apos; lives by contributing in this way.

Here is the survey link:
