    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName}!

Thanks for your interest in coming on a Live Different Build, we&apos;d love to have you join us this year!

We noticed that you started filling out the registration for one of our trips, but didn&apos;t complete it. Was that because you had some questions or were confused about some part of the form? We&apos;d love to help you out and answer any and all of your questions, (seriously...ask as many as you&apos;d like, we&apos;re used to it!), so please send us an email or give us a call!

Thanks,

{!Lead.OwnerFullName}
{!Lead.OwnerTitle}
