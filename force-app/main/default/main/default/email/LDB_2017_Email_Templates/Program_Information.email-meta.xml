    <textOnly>Hi there,

Thanks so much for your interest in what we do at Live Different. We have three main ways that people generally get involved with volunteering with Live Different.

The first being our Live Different Builds program where we facilitate public and private humanitarian work trips to The Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Mexico. These groups participate in house/clinic/school/etc building projects that we partner with local communities on.

The second is our Live Different Presentations program where a number of teams tour across Canada each school year, putting on motivational presentations for high schools and middles schools. These include live music, personal stories, videos, crowd interactions, etc.

The third is our Live Different Academy which is a 3 month program for young leaders (usually between 18 and 25) who spend that time down in Mexico, immersing themselves in the local community, learning spanish, helping to teach english, and gaining new perspectives and insight around social justice and poverty issues.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.
