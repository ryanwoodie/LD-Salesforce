<p>Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>

<p>As a former school principal, however, I know just how life-changing and enriching these Build trips are for youth. I’d love to be able to provide any support or reassurance that you might need to make it a reality. Feel free to grab a time in my <a href="https://calendar.app.google/1b8CD8PCTrH5EPoX7" target="_blank"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">calendar</span></a>, or here is my cell phone number: 905-802-7880. I’m happy to answer any questions that either of you might have.And <span style="color:rgb(13, 13, 13);">when you are ready, here's how to proceed:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose an upcoming public Build <a href="https://livedifferent.com/programs/builds/all-builds/" target="_blank"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">here</span></a>.</li>
	<li>Register, and then let me know via email or message. I'll ensure your bursary is applied.</li>
</ul>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Jenn Quong</p>
