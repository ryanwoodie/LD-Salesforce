    <subject>Your feedback on this year&apos;s Live Different resources?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for hosting our Live Different team at {!Account.Name} recently! I am wondering if you would be able to help give some quick feedback regarding the Transition Activity Lesson Plan and Poster Wall activity that we leave behind with schools following the presentation? It is very valuable for us to find out early in the school year how these resources are working, so that we can make beneficial changes and updates.

Thank you so much for your help and advice towards improving the work we do in schools.

Kind Regards,

Ryan Wood
