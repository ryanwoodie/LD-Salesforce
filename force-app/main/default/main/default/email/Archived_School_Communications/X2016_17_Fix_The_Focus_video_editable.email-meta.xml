Fix Your Focus  -  Choosing Empathy First
Our goal is to inspire your students to adopt a lifestyle of empathy and compassion for others. Establishing a fundamental understanding of empathy, we will practically equip them with empathic skills that they can continue to practice and develop. Cultivating empathy is one of the most significant keys to creating a compassionate, connected, and resilient student body.

Engage
We are wired to be empathic; our brains naturally mirror the emotions and feelings of others.  Our goal is to help students understand how empathy works and how they can consciously engage this capacity to care for others.

Listen
By understanding and exploring active listening, students can uncover their potential to empathize and understand the people they interact with. This skill will help them cultivate stronger and more authentic relationships.

Connect
We will help students understand the negative social process of othering (“us” vs. “them” thinking), and foster empathy by helping them see that we are all connected and far more similar than we are different.

About Live Different

Trusted by Canadian schools for over 16 years

We&apos;ve presented to over 1.1 Million students in 2,300 schools over the last 16 years.

After experiencing a Live Different presentation, 98% of educators rank it better than other presentations they have had in their school.

What makes our presentations different?

Most programs lecture on outward behaviors/symptoms (which research shows can be counter-productive). Our positive approach cuts through to root causes and mindsets, igniting change from within.

The true impact of our presentation comes from the power of the personal story. Young people, sharing their stories of hope, connect with students like nothing else.

Our upbeat, high energy concert-style presentation keeps students fully engaged and tuned-in to a message that will change their life.

Our messaging will spark meaningful discussions across your student body, inspiring students that need help to reach out.

What others are saying

&quot;I&apos;m not sure how the presentation could be improved- it was absolutely amazing! I heard comments like &apos;That&apos;s the best presentation I have seen in my entire teaching career&apos; from a veteran teacher, and students were raving about it for days. It was very worthwhile and inspirational.&quot;
Jo&apos;ann Obrien, St James Regional High School

&quot;In my 17 years in education this is the best loved student assembly I have ever been to. Students were literally hugging me in thanks for bringing LIVE DIFFERENT in.&quot;
Lorna Cameron, E.W. Pratt High School

&quot;Finally a presentation that gets it right.  The perfect mix of a meaningful message presented in a fun and entertaining way.  I&apos;m looking forward to having them back next year!&quot;
Gary Watson, Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School
