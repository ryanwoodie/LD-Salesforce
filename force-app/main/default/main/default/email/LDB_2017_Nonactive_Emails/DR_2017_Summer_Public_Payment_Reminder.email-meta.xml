    <subject>Live Different Builds: Payment Reminder</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Everyone!


Only a month and a half left until your trip to Dominican Republic where you will be meeting the family you will be building with for the first time.


I just wanted to remind you that most of your payments should be up to date as of May 15th. If you are needing more time, as I know some of us have spoken about, please let me know and we can make an extension for another week for May 30th.

If you haven&apos;t sent me your flight itinerary yet, please do so as soon as possible!

Flight dates:

Airport: Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic - Airport Code: POP
Arrival: July 8, 2017 (most of our volunteers are coming down on July 7)
Departure: July 17, 2017 (most of our volunteers are leaving a day late on July 18)


Facebook Page:

Please add yourself to our private facebook page made for just your specific trip. You can get to know who the other volunteers are before your trip starts!

https://www.facebook.com/groups/233520863786273/

Family Profiles:

We will be sending out family profiles at the end of June so you can start to read who the family members are and get excited to meet them in person.

If you have questions, let me know.

Have a great week!
