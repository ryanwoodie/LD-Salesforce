    <textOnly>Hi Live Different Volunteers,

We wanted to thank you again for your support in building the school in Haiti!

Some time has past since you were last there, but a lot of progress has been made.

We know that many of you have left a little bit of your heart in Haiti, and are curious about what&apos;s going on at the school now. So we put together an update (with some photos too!).

Interested in visiting Haiti again?

Alumni Public Build - July 2016

For some of you, it&apos;s been a long time since you&apos;ve come on a trip with Live Different, while others may have just joined us on a trip this year. Either way, this Alumni trip is a great chance for you and the friends you&apos;ve made on past trips to return together, to help those in need in a tangible way. This time around, the trip is longer, (a full two weeks!), and you&apos;ll be working on building projects in not just one, but two of our destination countries - Dominican Republic and Haiti!

Do you have a friend or family member you want to introduce to Haiti? This year we are offering Alumni volunteers the opportunity to bring a plus one!

Again, we sincerely appreciate your support and look forward to seeing you on a Build in the future!

Thank you,

Live Different Team</textOnly>
