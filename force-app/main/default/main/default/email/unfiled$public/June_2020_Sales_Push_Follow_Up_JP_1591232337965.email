  Thanks for your quick response, Inshana! 
  <br /> 
  <br /> We are very aware of the uncertainty and challenges facing planning for this coming school year, which is why we have developed a completely new peer-mentorship program which can be facilitated online, should students not be back in the classroom come Fall. I don't actually know all of the details of the program yet, as we're anticipating an official launch next week, but it's sounding like an incredibly impactful opportunity for your students, and I just wanted to make sure that when we roll it out, we're sending the information to the right person. 
  <br /> 
  <br /> Thank again, and expect to hear from us real soon! We're excited to show you what we've been cooking up.
