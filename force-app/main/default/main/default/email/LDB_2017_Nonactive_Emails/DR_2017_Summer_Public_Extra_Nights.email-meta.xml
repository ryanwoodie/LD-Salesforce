    <textOnly>Hi Everyone,



For those of you who have sent me your flight itineraries already, thank you so much!



From what I can gather from everyone&apos;s itineraries is that everyone is flying into Puerto Plata on the same flight from Toronto with Westjet. I am still waiting on three other flight itineraries, so I am just assuming that you guys are this flight. If not, that&apos;s okay! Please forward the itineraries soon so I can make the shuttle arrangements.


Toronto Airport:

When you arrive at the Toronto airport, please check in and meet at the gate. I will be waiting there with a Live Different tshirt on an hour and a half before departure. This is my cell number if you can not find me and want to send me a text: 905 746 0698

Arrival in Puerto Plata:

We will grab our checked luggage together and head out to the parking lot in a group where a shuttle bus will be waiting for us and some of our Dominican ground staff that live there full time. We will arrive at the resort and check into our rooms.

Paying for your extra nights:

Remember that it is $42 USD per night if you are sharing a room with someone. It is $60 USD per night if you have your own private room (no one has requested this). I have booked everyone at the resort for two extra nights (night of July 7th and 17th) with a roommate so the cost should be $84 USD. You can pay with American cash or use a credit card when you check in on your first day. You must pay for your first and last night at the same time. I will be able to help you with this at the front desk.

July 7:

This is a free day, since everyone is arriving one day early. There is not definite plans, but we might have a quick orientation night so you can learn the schedule for the week.

July 17 and 18:

July 17th would normally be the day that all the volunteers fly out, so instead, this is a free day to relax after many days of hard work. On the 18th, a staff member will be taking you guys to the airport and flying back to Toronto with you.

If anyone has any questions, please email me as soon as possible!

Have a great week.
