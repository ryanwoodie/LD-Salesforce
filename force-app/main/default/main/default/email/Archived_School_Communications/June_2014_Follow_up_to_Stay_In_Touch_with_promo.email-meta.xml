Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope your week is starting off well! I am following up to see if you received the email that I sent a few weeks ago regarding whether you are still involved with bringing presentations into your school? Since it has been a while since we have been in touch, I have attached some information about our program (below). I am happy to answer any questions you may have, or to update our contact information if this is no longer relevant to you.

Thanks so much and enjoy the rest of your day!

All the best,

{!User.FirstName}

Hour-long School Presentation  Empowering Life Stories Inspiring Videos  Live Band   Grades 7 &amp; up

This is the character development presentation that students, parents, and teachers will thank you for bringing to your school! You&apos;ll capture your students&apos; attention and transform them with a message that matters.

Trusted by Canadian schools for over 15 years

We&apos;ve presented to over 1.1 Million students in 2227 schools over the last 15 years.

After experiencing a Live Different presentation, 98% of educators rank it better than other presentations they have had in their school.

What makes our presentations different?

Most programs lecture on outward behaviors/symptoms (which research shows can be counter-productive). Our positive approach cuts through to root causes and mindsets, igniting change from within.

The true impact of our presentation comes from the power of the personal story. Young people, sharing their stories of hope, connect with students like nothing else.

Our upbeat, high energy concert-style presentation keeps students fully engaged and tuned-in to a message that will change their life.

Our messaging will spark meaningful discussions across your student body, inspiring students that need help to reach out.

What others are saying

&quot;I&apos;m not sure how the presentation could be improved- it was absolutely amazing! I heard comments like &apos;That&apos;s the best presentation I have seen in my entire teaching career&apos; from a veteran teacher, and students were raving about it for days. It was very worthwhile and inspirational.&quot;
Jo&apos;ann Obrien, St James Regional High School

&quot;In my 17 years in education this is the best loved student assembly I have ever been to. Students were literally hugging me in thanks for bringing LIVE DIFFERENT in.&quot;
Lorna Cameron, E.W. Pratt High School

&quot;The Live Different presentation was a powerful experience for both staff and students. The message of Kindness was empowering and the connection they made with the audience was phenomenal and students remained actively engaged throughout. Students loved their slide presentation and the live music performed by their band. We look forward to having them back again.&quot;
Mary Jacquart, Georges P. Vanier Junior High School

As a charity, we make our presentation accessible to every school with donation-based pricing. Your donation will not only help bring this life-changing program to your school, but to other students across the country.

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

This is {!User.FirstName} from Live Different. I hope you&apos;re enjoying the last weeks of the school year! We visited {!Account.Name} on {!Account.Most_recent_presentation_text_date__c} with our motivational presentation (known as &quot;Absolute&quot; back then), but it seems as though we haven&apos;t connected in awhile. I wanted to touch base to see how things are going and if you&apos;re still at the same school? Are you still involved in planning school assemblies if I were to send you some information and tour dates for 2014/2015, or is there a better contact or email address?

Thanks so much {!Contact.FirstName}! Enjoy the rest of your day and I&apos;ll look forward to hearing from you soon.

All the best,
