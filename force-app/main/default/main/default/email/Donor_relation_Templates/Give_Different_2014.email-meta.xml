    <textOnly>Live Different shirts make a great Christmas gift because they look awesome, and because the proceeds of each sale goes directly to our charitable programs. They&apos;re really a gift that keeps on giving, helping us to make a difference in communities across Canada and around the world.

This Holiday Season, we&apos;re excited to release our new, LIMITED EDITION zip up hoodies. They&apos;re super stylish, AND super cozy for the winter! 100% of the proceeds of these hoodies will go towards Live Different&apos;s student empowerment programs, bringing a message of hope to young people across Canada through our high school presentations.
