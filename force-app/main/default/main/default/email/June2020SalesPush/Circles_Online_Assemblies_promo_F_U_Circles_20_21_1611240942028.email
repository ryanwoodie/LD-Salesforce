<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
I hope you're doing well. Did you receive&nbsp;my earlier message about helping to keep young people&nbsp;engaged and inspired&nbsp;during these unique times?&nbsp;We know educators are struggling to make everything work AND have their students feeling connected, so&nbsp;we're here to help.<br />
<br />
Within our newly designed&nbsp;school program,&nbsp;<a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/">Circles</a>, one of the exciting&nbsp;aspects for&nbsp;2021 is that <b>we're&nbsp;offering to lead 1-HOUR&nbsp;</b><a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-assembly/"><b>ONLINE SCHOOL ASSEMBLIES</b></a><b>!</b>&nbsp;Videos, speakers, discussion activities, and opportunities for even more engagement around important conversations. You pick one of the six available topics and&nbsp;we'll handle the rest! Some schools are taking advantage of everything that Circles has to offer, but for those simply looking for a 1-hour, engaging event that&nbsp;LiveDifferent leads for them, our online assemblies are&nbsp;a fantastic option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We've partnered&nbsp;with thousands of schools across Canada and although this year is unique&nbsp;for each and every one of them, together we're still having&nbsp;a positive impact in the lives of young people.&nbsp; Let's do the same for your students!<br />
<br />
Thanks so much {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;</p>
