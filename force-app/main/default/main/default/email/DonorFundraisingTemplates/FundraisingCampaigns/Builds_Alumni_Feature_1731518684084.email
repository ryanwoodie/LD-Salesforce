<p>Dear&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>

<p>We need your help! As we prepare for our upcoming holiday campaign, we’d love to feature you. You volunteered on a Build trip when you were a youth, and now, as a young adult, we want to highlight your journey—both during and after your Build experience.</p>

<p>This campaign will support our <a href="https://livedifferent.com/get-involved/support/youth-scholarship-fund/"><strong>Youth Scholarship Fund</strong></a>, which helps send youth on Builds trips who need a little extra financial support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Would you be willing to send us a <strong>short video (30-60 seconds in portrait mode)</strong> answering a few questions<strong> OR</strong> simply reply with your responses via <strong>written email</strong> along with a photo of you on your Build as well as a current photo?</p>

<p>Here are the questions we’d love you to answer:</p>

<ol>
	<li>What year did you volunteer for your first Build trip, and which country did you visit?</li>
	<li>What were some core memories from your time on the Build trip?</li>
	<li>How did your experience on Build inspire your path in life?</li>
	<li>What are you doing now? (school, family, work, etc.)</li>
	<li>Why do you think it’s important to invest in youth?</li>
	<li>Feel free to share anything else you'd like with us!</li>
</ol>

<p>We plan to launch this campaign by the end of the month, so we’d appreciate receiving your video submission by <strong>November 28th</strong>.&nbsp;Some of your content may be featured on our LiveDifferent Facebook page, Instagram, website, and in our newsletters. It’s a wonderful opportunity to inspire others and celebrate the lasting impact of your experience!</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your time and support. We truly appreciate your ongoing contribution to the LiveDifferent community. If you have any questions or need more information, please don’t hesitate to reach out!</p>

<p>With love,<br />
<br />
