    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

Thank you for registering for the Live Different Summer Internship!
Our interns play a big role in helping our summer Builds be a huge success. You will help staff with behind the scenes jobs, be a role model to first time volunteers, and make a difference in the communities we work in.

Registering online is the first step to becoming a summer intern, but there are a few more tasks to check off before you&apos;re fully registered.

Application Questions

Click on the link below to complete the Application Questions

Phone Interview

Please contact me to set up an interview within the next 2 weeks (joy@livedifferent.com)
Interviews will take place Mon - Fri between 9:30 am and 4:30 pm and will be about 20 minutes long.
In your email, please provide me with three options of dates/times that you are available. (Remember that our office is in Ontario, so take the time difference into consideration.)

The phone interview will be very casual and you don&apos;t need to &quot;prepare&quot; for it. It will be very laid back -  just think of it as having a conversation with me!
Some of the main points we will discuss are:

Summer Schedule

Internship Responsibilities

Internship Assignments

Review of Application Questions

Scenario Based Questions


Wait for Acceptance Email

After you&apos;ve completed the above two tasks, and if you have been successful, you will receive an Acceptance Email.
In this email you will receive instructions on how to send us your consent package and $300 deposit.
Please wait until you&apos;re officially accepted before paying your deposit.

Again, thank you SO much for volunteering to be a leader on our Live Different Summer Builds. It&apos;s people like YOU who are going to make this world a better place!

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
Thank you,
