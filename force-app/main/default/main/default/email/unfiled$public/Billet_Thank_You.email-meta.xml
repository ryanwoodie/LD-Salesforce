    <textOnly>Dear Friend,

On behalf of our road teams and all of us here at Live Different, we would like to thank you for hosting the members our road team this year. It is your generosity that makes it possible for us to travel across Canada and to influence the youth of our nation. We understand that it takes a lot of time, resources, and attention to host our team in your home and community, and we greatly value the contribution you have made to our team, and the real help your hospitality was to us!

Thank you also for filling out the survey form that we sent you earlier. Your feedback is valuable and will help us to identify ways to make your experience with our teams better. Please feel free to contact me if you have any comments or concerns. 

If you would like to know more information about Live Different&apos;s presentations, Live Different Build, the Live Different Academy, or to talk about other ways that you can become more involved with us, please don&apos;t hesitate to let us know! 


Thanks,
Brett Dyrland
