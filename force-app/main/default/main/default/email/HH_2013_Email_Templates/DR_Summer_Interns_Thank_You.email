Time is really flying by this summer and it's been just over a week since we were last together in Dominican Republic! We are currently building 4 houses in Nuevo Renacer and just had our movie night last night in Arroyo Seco. It was really cute, we got to watch The Lorax by Dr. Seuss and the kids loved it! We were able to serve popcorn to all the kids and volunteers.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">All the staff got a week long break between the trips to rest and think about our busy July that we just had. Besides watching all of the videos and photos posted on facebook, we got to swap stories on everything that had happened and we realized how much we miss having the support of all of you down here with us. The hotel is very quiet and all of you are missed in both communities.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I just want you guys to know the significant difference you made in July. Let's quickly recap. In one month, we built 5 houses and a medical clinic, we ran a Talent/Art workshop for 80 kids, we had a movie night in the community, we built over 500 new relationships with our translators, volunteers, contractors, families, and the people in the community...WOW! That's all I have to say...is that you guys are amazing people and more than extraordinary!&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">As a team, we feel so privileged to have met each and every one of&nbsp;</span><span class="il" style="font-size: 13px;">you</span><span style="font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;on this trip.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span class="il">Thank</span>&nbsp;<span class="il">you</span>&nbsp;to every one of you who opened up in different "sharing circles" with our volunteers.

They told me that Stephanie (the younger sister who is at he orphanage) got to visit home for 3 days, and the next time they will get to see her again is December. When Stephanie visited, Kelvin and Henry told her stories about all of her new friends and she really wanted to meet all of us. I wasn't around when she visited, nor was any of our team. But she apparently ran all around Nuevo Renacer asking where the group of gringos was! Super adorable. The grandmother isn't dong so well, so is now being treated in Santiago, which is over an hour away. We just had 2 people on our trip experience "A Day in the Life of..." yesterday so we were able to help them out with a meal.</div></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><br></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><u>The family with the old lady with breast cancer:</u></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We are not exactly sure what we can do yet, but we returned yesterday with our volunteers and we are trying to figure out how we can reinforce her house with more block to fit a door on their house. Right now, there is too much mold between the wood to attach a door that will hold. But we are doing everything we can to keep them in mind for a future building project.</span></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><u>The family with the old lady with the tumor on her neck:</u></span></div><div>Benedita and Randy!
