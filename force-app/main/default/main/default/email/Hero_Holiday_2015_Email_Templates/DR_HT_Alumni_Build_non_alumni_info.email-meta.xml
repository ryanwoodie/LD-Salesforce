    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for registering for the Live Different Alumni Build!

At this time, we are holding all spaces on this trip for Live Different Alumni. If the trip isn&apos;t full by February 1, 2015, we will consider opening it up to the general public.

We really appreciate your willingness to volunteer with us and we would love to have you on a trip. You have a few options:

I can place your name on a DR/Haiti Alumni Trip Wait List. If we decide to open this trip up to the general public, we will let you know. (To be determined by February 1, 2015.)
We have two public trips happening in the Dominican Republic and Mexico during the summer months. You are welcome to register for either of these trips.

Thank you,
