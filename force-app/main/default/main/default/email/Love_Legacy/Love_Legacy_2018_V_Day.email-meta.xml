    <subject>Happy Valentines Day from Live Different and Ecole L&apos;Union!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

The families in the community of Calvaire have always inspired us with their resourcefulness and resilience.

Each day, more than 300 students at Ecole L&apos;Union have been growing and learning… all without electricity. Unlike our current system in Canada, power isn’t necessary for schools and education. Being unplugged hasn’t impacted the children&apos;s progress—because classes are run in the daytime—but providing the school with solar power will allow us to accomplish much more for the community.

Today in Calvaire, the sun will set at 5:41pm and now with the lights shining bright, the learning doesn&apos;t have to stop! Our goal is for the school to double as a community centre while offering adult education in the evenings. Now, we are one giant step closer.

Thank you so much for supporting E&apos;cole L&apos;Union.  Momentum is building and lives are truly being changed.

We hope you have had a great start to your 2018!

We&apos;ll be in touch soon.
