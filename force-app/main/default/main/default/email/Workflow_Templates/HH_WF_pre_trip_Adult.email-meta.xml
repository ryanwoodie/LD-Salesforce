Hey there {!Opportunity.Survey_Name__c}!

We are excited to have you join us on a Live Different Build! Get ready to learn, serve, and to have your worldview changed, because you will not be the same after this!

As you are preparing and packing for your trip, we would like to give you a few thoughts and ideas to consider that can help to make the most of your Live Different Build.

We encourage you all to invest some time in learning about the culture you are going to be visiting. Google is your friend! Take a minute and learn a little bit about the culture and even arm yourself with a few basic words of greeting from the local language. You will be surprised at how much it will mean to the people you meet, and it will help to build a bridge for you right from the start.
Please remember that the people you are going to be working with are often coming from a different perspective and life experience than what you may be accustomed to. Neither perspective may necessarily be right or wrong - just different. The best way to learn and grow from an experience like this is to have an open mindset about what you see and experience.
When you are packing, don&apos;t forget all the obvious good stuff like sunblock, work clothes/hats, and water bottles - you will need them and be very glad you have them. Also, there&apos;s one thing that we&apos;d encourage you not to pack. After many years of working in various communities and countries, we&apos;ve learned that bringing donations to distribute can cause many problems, both in the communities that we work in, and also for the local economy. If you&apos;d like to learn more about this, please visit the Aid and Donations section of our website. Rather than bringing donated items with you, we ask that you focus your efforts on raising extra funds that will go directly toward locally purchased items for our families as they set up in their new homes. Any surplus funds raised will go towards our Community Development Funds. If you have questions, or would like more info on how to raise extra funds, please contact us!.
Get ready to meet new people, live out new experiences and to build friendships that may last a lifetime. Live Different Builds are about people - in our project communities and on our volunteer teams. We need each other, and after you have experienced this for yourself, you will hopefully feel the same.
If possible, we encourage you to contact anyone who has sponsored you. Thank them again for their support and give them our website and facebook pages to follow your trip blogs and updates. Let&apos;s get the word out on what you are a part of!

Most of all, get ready to have the experience of a lifetime! See you soon!

See you soon!



Sincerely,
The Live Different Team
