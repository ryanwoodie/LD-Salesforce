    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for filling out our Stay Involved Card at the end of your trip to let us know about the ways you&apos;d like to get involved here at Live Different!

You noted that you were interested in our Summer Internships!

The dates for our internships in 2015 are:

Dominican Republic - July 3 - 16, 2015
Mexico - July 31 - August 13, 2015
*Is this year too soon to plan for? Contact us to plan for a summer internship in 2016!

Our internship program is highly recommended for people who are looking to develop their international experience and leadership skills. As an intern, you will have the privilege to be a part of the behind-the-scenes work of a humanitarian trip. You will be able to develop your leadership skills by receiving practical, hands-on experience. Our interns are an integral part of what happens during our summer Live Different Trips, building significant connections in both the communities we work in and with other volunteers.

Please feel free to contact us with any other questions.

Thanks,

Live Different Team</textOnly>
