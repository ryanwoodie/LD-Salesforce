    <textOnly>Hey Mexicans!

I just want you guys to know the significant difference you made in August. Let&apos;s quickly recap. In one month, you guys, with your teams built 7 homes for amazing families.You built over 500 new relationships with our translators, volunteers, families, our staff and the people in the community...WOW! That&apos;s all I have to say...is that you guys are amazing people and more than extraordinary!

As a team, our staff feel so privileged to have met each and every one of you on this trip.

Thank you to every one of you who stepped up to the plate this summer and poured your hearts our to our volunteers and to each other.


Now...down to business, here&apos;s a couple updates just in case anyone is wondering or has forgotten:

Volunteer Hours

If you need a reference letter with your 100 hours of volunteer service, please let me know.

Reference Letters

If you need a reference letter that is specific for a scholarship, please send me an email, even if you need it 6 months - a year from now, I would be happy to help.

Academy

Our applications for next year will be going up in a few weeks for the 2014 fall year.


Don&apos;t Forget!

Share your stories, print off photos, and stay connected with the new friends you have made on the trip!

Thank You!

This is a personal thank you from each one of us staff members here at Live Different. If you did not decide to come on this trip, the lives of the people you met wouldn&apos;t have had you to call their friend this summer. So from Live Different and our friends in Mexico, thanks for giving up your vacation time and half your summer to join us in building relationships.


Talk to you soon. If you need anything, don&apos;t hesitate to send me an email or call!
