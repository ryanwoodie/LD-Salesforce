<p>Hey {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>

<p>After high school, the world is your oyster! But how do you know which path is right for you? That's where our Academy program comes in.</p>

<p>Imagine spending 13 weeks journeying through Haiti, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. You'll explore global justice issues, learn new languages, and engage in community projects that make a lasting impact.</p>

<p>Here's what one of our recent Academy participants had to say:</p>

<blockquote><em>"It is important to know that this experience will change you. You can't go through an experience like this without letting it alter your way of thinking and viewing the world. Do something each day that makes you a little uncomfortable."</em></blockquote>
