Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

This is Ryan Wood here from Live Different, and I hope that you are looking forward to a wonderful summer break! I am contacting you as you are on our Live Different Consultant list and we are needing input on possible changes to our pricing approach.

As a charity our purpose is not for profit, but to affect positive development in youth, and so we have always provided our program on a donation basis to make sure that any school, regardless of budget, can access a top-notch presentation for their students. Our multi-media motivational experience is quite large/elaborate, and yearly program expenses average out to about $1500 per school, but our average school donation is under $600. So, we work hard internally to fundraise over $200,000/year to fund the cost gap. To help address the growth and sustainability challenge this creates, we want to explore options with our pricing model and if we can better collaborate with schools to be able to increase the average school donation, but without making our program less accessible, (ie. have our cake and eat it too ;-).

Here is a link to a survey form. If you would be willing to give your input on this form, it would be a great help to us:

Our Live Different Consultants have become an incredible help to us, resulting in many program improvements over the past year, and we sincerely thank you for your ongoing support and input.

Kindest Regards,

Ryan Wood
