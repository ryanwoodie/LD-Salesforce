    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope your Holiday season has been restful and enjoyable!
I&apos;m just following up with an email I sent earlier regarding the opportunity to have our motivational team visit your school this year. Our 2013/2014 presentations have been extremely well received across the country so far and with a limited number or dates available, we&apos;d love for your students to experience this presentation as well.

As a reminder, our 2013/2014 presentation theme is &quot;Kindness Changes Everything&quot; and we&apos;re seeing it positively impact the culture in Canadian schools each and every day.

Thank you for considering this opportunity and the meaningful investment it is in your students.
