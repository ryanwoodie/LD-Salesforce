    <textOnly>Hi Everyone,

Here is the link to your trip photos: http://media.livedifferent.com/?c=336&amp;k=fb515b4337

How did your trip go? I hope everyone had a great time making new friends, meeting the families, and creating some change in the community. I loved seeing all of your photos and sad that I couldn&apos;t meet some of you in person. But really happy with everyone&apos;s work ethic! Our staff has said nothing but great things!

Have an awesome rest of your summer!
