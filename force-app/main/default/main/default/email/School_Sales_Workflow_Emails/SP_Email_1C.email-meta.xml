Hi {!Account.SP_First_Name__c},

I hope you&apos;re doing well and having a great school year.  It is my understanding that you are a good person to speak with concerning youth development initiatives (character ed, mental health, bullying prevention, etc.) at {!Account.Name}.

I was hoping to learn a bit what your insights, goals and needs are in this area, and find out if the presentation/assembly that Live Different offers might be something that would aide your efforts to improve your students&apos; wellbeing. If you haven&apos;t heard of Live Different before, we are one of the most established and trusted non-profit youth development organizations in Canada, and are considered by many educators to offer the best youth motivational presentation in Canada.

If you would be so kind as to give a brief reply just so I know you received my email successfully, it would be much appreciated! I will also try to call you in a couple of days and hopefully connect then!

Following this email I have included some details on our program, and here is a quick introduction video that might interest you: click here to view

Kindest Regards,

Hour-long School Presentation  Empowering Life Stories Inspiring Videos  Live Band   Grades 7 &amp; up

This is the character development presentation that students, parents, and teachers will thank you for bringing to your school! You&apos;ll capture your students&apos; attention and transform them with a message that matters.

Trusted by Canadian schools for over 16 years

We&apos;ve presented to over 1.1 Million students in 2,300 schools over the last 15 years.

After experiencing a Live Different presentation, 98% of educators rank it better than most presentations they have had in their school.

What makes our presentations different?

Most programs lecture on outward behaviors/symptoms (which research shows can be counter-productive). Our positive approach cuts through to root causes and mindsets, igniting change from within.

The true impact of our presentation comes from the power of the personal story. Young people, sharing their stories of hope, connect with students like nothing else.

Our upbeat, high energy concert-style presentation keeps students fully engaged and tuned-in to a message that will change their life.

Our messaging will spark meaningful discussions across your student body, inspiring students that need help to reach out.

What others are saying

&quot;I&apos;m not sure how the presentation could be improved- it was absolutely amazing! I heard comments like &apos;That&apos;s the best presentation I have seen in my entire teaching career&apos; from a veteran teacher, and students were raving about it for days. It was very worthwhile and inspirational.&quot;
Jo&apos;ann Obrien, St James Regional High School

&quot;In my 17 years in education this is the best loved student assembly I have ever been to. Students were literally hugging me in thanks for bringing LIVE DIFFERENT in.&quot;
Lorna Cameron, E.W. Pratt High School

&quot;Finally a presentation that gets it right.  The perfect mix of a meaningful message presented in a fun and entertaining way.  I&apos;m looking forward to having them back next year!&quot;
Gary Watson, Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School

As a charity, we make our presentation accessible to every school with donation-based pricing. Your donation will not only help bring this life-changing program to your school, but to other students across the country.

Our 2015/16 presentation will help your students shift from being passive spectators of their life stories to being the authors of them - creating a sense of identity, ownership, and hope for the future.
