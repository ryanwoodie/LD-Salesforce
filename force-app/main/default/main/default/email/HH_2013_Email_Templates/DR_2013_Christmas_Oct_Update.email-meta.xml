    <textOnly>Hey everyone!



I am so excited for our trip to Dominican Republic during this Christmas/New Years season. We have finalized our staff for the trip and I am very stoked to be meeting all of you in person as I will also be joining you. Please let me know if you have any further questions after reading this email.



Trip Availability

This is an update email to let everyone know that we had 3 people back out of the trip this week so we are opening up registration for one more week. If you have any friends or family members who missed out on signing up, please let them know that they have until next Monday to sign up!



Booking your flights:

If you haven&apos;t already checked out your trip page, please do so this week  so you can become familiar with our trip itinerary and start booking your flights to Puerto Plata, DR: http://livedifferent.com/hero-holiday/trips/christmas-public-trip

Airport: Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic - Airport Code: POP
Arrival: December 27th, 2013

Staying extra nights:

If you are arriving early or departing later, please let me know and I can book you at our resort for those extra nights.



Final payment deadline is coming up in a month on October 31st:

Use your Canada Helps Page for making, entering and requesting donations or payments related to your trip. You can share (email, Facebook, etc.) your Canada Helps Page with any potential donors so they can donate online to your Live Different Build project (to help meet your fundraising goal).

Final payment deadline is coming up in a month on October 31st:

Our group of 40 will be split up into 3 teams to build for 3 families. Once we have finalized which families we are building for in which communities, I will email everyone with the names, ages, and information about the families. I can&apos;t wait!

GIFTS!

Live Different is trying to get away from the &quot;gift give away&quot;  attitude within the communities that we are working in. We are finding  that it has the potential to create unhealthy relationships and we  desire to build relationships that are best for us as an organization,  the community, and our volunteers. We ask that you come with only ONE  checked bag (if possible). You are welcome to bring items for the family  you are building for if you have extra room or some of the following  items listed below. Please only bring items on this list and help us  continue our work in the communities in a health manner. Thank you for  honouring this request. We will provide more details on this point  during our time together in DR.

new bed sheets (for double beds)
new towels (all sizes)
curtains
new table cloths
kitchen supplies - tupperware containers, cooking utensils, serving items, anything that you personally find helpful in the kitchen
bubbles
water guns
baby items
notebooks and pens



Through our extensive experience working with groups, we have found that the best way to help your family is to pool extra donated money together in the DR, to buy the larger items for their house. With this money, based on the family&apos;s need, we have been able to purchase things such as groceries, beds, table &amp; chairs, stove, fridge, and other much needed items. In doing this, we help assist the family into a new and healthy future.



Upon Arrival:
All volunteers fly into the Puerto Plata Airport (POP) and our staff will pick them up and we will drive them to the resort.



Pick up and drop off:
Once you have booked your flights, please forward me your trip itinerary and I can add you to our bus shuttle. When you arrive at the Puerto Plata Airport, our staff will be at the gate wearing a Live Different t-shirt and holding a Live Different Build sign, and you will then be taken to Sosua by the Sea Resort in Sosua (10 minutes away from the airport).

After we drop off the volunteers at the airport on their last day, they get on their flight and they&apos;re on their own from there on. All the volunteers can be picked up on the other side by their parents or other family members.



Accommodations:
We stay at a small and clean resort called Sosua by the Sea. It is located 10 minutes away from the Puerto Plata Airport in a town called Sosua. The rooms provided there can fit up to 4 people in a room with 2 beds. There is a private pool and beach that is accessible for all volunteers. There is a buffet-style dining hall that we are able to transform into an event hall for all of our evening activities. The hotel has security guards that monitor the resort at all times to ensure our safety. Shower towels, beach towels, a safe with a key, and bedding are all provided by the resort.



Transportation:
We hire bus drivers for transportation and they arrive every morning at the resort to take us to the communities we will be working in. The drivers are experienced drivers whom we have been working with since 2005, they have experience driving in Dominican Republic, as well as the legal documents to drive these registered vehicles.



Communities We Work In:
Since 2005, we have developed very strong relationships with the communities that we work in. The communities know Live Different very well and we feel very safe at all times while working on our building sites.



Work Site Safety:
We require all volunteers to bring down closed toed shoes, a hat/bandana, waterbottle, sunglasses, sunscreen, and leather work gloves. This ensures that volunteers are as equipped for handling equipment on the job sites.



Vaccinations and Medications:
We do not require that any of our volunteers receive any vaccinations or medications to go to any of the countries that we work in. But, we do suggest that every volunteer visit their family doctor or local medical clinic and decide on your own about taking any medications or vaccinations prior to the trip.



Excursion Day (trip specific):
There are a few options for the excursion day that our staff will decide on closer to the date of the trip (cascading, horse back riding, zip lining, kayaking). There will be a staff member supervising each group that will be going on an excursion. If volunteers do not want to sign up for an excursion, they are welcome to stay back at the resort with our staff members.



Contact during a trip between volunteers and Canada:
There is wifi available at the resort, a wifi code can be purchased at the front desk. Due to the fact that we will be using internet in a developing country, it will be hard for volunteers to receive a well enough connection skype with their family members, but they can indeed use Facebook and e-mail. We also have a Facebook page that we update every day to keep family and friends informed. All of our staff have cell phones on them at all times.We will be emailing everyone all of the emergency contact information before the trip starts.
