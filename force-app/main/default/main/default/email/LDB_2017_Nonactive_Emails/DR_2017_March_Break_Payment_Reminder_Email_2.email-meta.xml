    <textOnly>Hello everyone!



Only a few more weeks left until you are meeting the family you will be building for. This just a reminder that if you have not sent me your flight info yet that I will need it by the end of this week.



We have a facebook group created for all of you lovely volunteers. It will be a great way for everyone to ask questions before the trip starts. Also, a few days before the trip start date, I will let you know that you can add your family members so we can post updates in the group for them to see.



For now, please add yourself into the group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1257354331027040/



Post a little introduction of who you are, where you are from and what you are the most excited about for the trip.



I can&apos;t wait to chat! Hope this helps with communication before and during the trip. If you have questions let me know.
