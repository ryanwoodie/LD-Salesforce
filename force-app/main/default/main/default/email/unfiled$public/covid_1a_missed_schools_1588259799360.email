   <meta />Hi 
   <meta charset="utf-8" />{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}<strong>!</strong></p> 
  <p>I hope you and your loved ones are doing well.</p> 
  <p>I wanted to reach out and say thank you, both for your patience as Live Different has been adapting to these changing times and for your continued commitment to the wellbeing of your amazing students. We sure did miss seeing them in person this semester with the “Own Your Story” presentation and we want you to know that our focus is squarely on remaining an important source of support and inspiration within their lives and the culture of your school.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Over the past number of weeks, we have been developing interactive programming that still effectively meets young people right where they’re at with an important message. We have started offering our “Own Your Story” program in a live, <a href="https://livedifferent.com/ld/own-your-story-online">interactive online format,</a> where students are able to watch cool videos, listen to meaningful stories, and participate in practical learning activities all led by Live Different staff. <i><em><strong>We hav</strong><strong>e limited bookings available for this and wanted to let you know about it first before we reach out to more schools next week.&nbsp;</strong></em></i></p> 
  <p>Also, if organizing an official online presentation for your grade/school isn’t possible, we’ll be facilitating a public one on 
   <meta charset="utf-8" /><strong>Thurs May 14th @ 2pm EST</strong> that you can feel free to invite any and all interested students to. Here is the event/registration page that you can share with them: <a href="https://livedifferent.com/ld/own-your-story-online">https://livedifferent.com/ld/own-your-story-online</a></p> 
  <p>Aside from that, 
   <meta charset="utf-8" /><strong>next week we’ll be sending you some fantastic “Own Your Story” resources</strong> (videos, activities, etc) that your teachers can use as you continue to add invaluable positive mental health/character education components to their remote teaching.</p> 
  <p>Thanks again and I look forward to talking with you soon!</p> 
  <p>All the best,<br /> &nbsp;</p>
