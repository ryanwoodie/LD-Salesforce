  <p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}!<br /> <br /> I hope you're having a great week so far.&nbsp;Have you had a chance to look at the info I sent earlier about&nbsp;how we can support you and your students before the end of the school year? We've had lots of schools utilizing our new Circles programming, especially the engaging online assemblies portion, and I'm wondering if we could do something similar for yours.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>"<span style="color:#555555;">The LiveDifferent Circles (assemblies)&nbsp;are perfect for the current times we live in. The presentations on "Resilience" and "Empathy" were both exactly what our students needed at this point in the year and the format kept them active and engaged.</span><span style="color:#000000;">"</span></i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b>Principal in Saskatchewan</b>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">"<span style="color:#555555;"><i>I got to share my thoughts with my class and I couldn't (have done) that before this assembly. The LiveDifferent assembly is life changing.</i></span>" - <b>Student in Ontario</b></span><br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGaviLF3FO8"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-17 at 11.44.21 AM" src="{[devName:Screen_Shot_20210317_at_114421_AM]}" style="max-width: 697.128px; width: 525px; height: 272.135px;" title="Screen Shot 2021-03-17 at 11.44.21 AM" /></a><br /> <br /> If you could take a minute and have a peak at the programming here, I'd really appreciate it:&nbsp;<a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-assembly/">https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-assembly/</a>&nbsp;It's super&nbsp;versatile and adaptable to any&nbsp;of the&nbsp;challenges your school or schedule might be facing. In fact, many of the schools who thought they were just too busy to do&nbsp;anything&nbsp;else&nbsp;found it to be a perfect fit and exactly what their students needed during these chaotic times.<br /> <br /> Let me know what you think and if you have any questions at all.&nbsp;I'll be happy to help make your year a little easier and a little more successful!<br /> <br /> Thanks so much {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, I look forward to hearing from you soon.</span></p>
