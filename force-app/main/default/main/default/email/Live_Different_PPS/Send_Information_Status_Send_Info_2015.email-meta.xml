Live Different
We are about seeing change.
We are about building hope.
We are about embracing a lifestyle of caring for people, not &quot;stuff&quot;.
We believe that together, we really can make a difference!


Live Different was established as a Canadian non-profit organization
in 2000, and began operating internationally in 2005. From the very
beginning we have been passionate about making a difference in the
lives of the students and teachers we encounter through our youth
empowerment presentations, our humanitarian build programs, and
our leadership development opportunities.


In addition to an engaging concert-style motivational assembly, Live
Different offers supplementary class-room workshops, keynote speakers,
as well as youth programs and resources that inspire students to take
immediate action to make a positive difference in their world.


Over the past 15 years we have had the opportunity to speak to over
1 million students – in 2200 schools – to build over 350 homes, schools,
and other projects, and to mentor over 5,000 students, interns, and volunteers.


Here’s what just a few school Principals had to say about Live Different:

&quot;I&apos;m not sure how the presentation could be improved- it was absolutely
amazing! I heard comments like &apos;That&apos;s the best presentation I have seen
in my entire teaching career&apos; from a veteran teacher, and students were
raving about it for days. It was very worthwhile and inspirational.&quot;

Jo&apos;ann Obrien, St James Regional High School


&quot;In my 17 years in education this is the best loved student assembly I
have ever been to. Students were literally hugging me in thanks for
bringing LIVE DIFFERENT in.&quot;

Lorna Cameron, E.W. Pratt High School


&quot;The Live Different presentation was a powerful experience for both
staff and students. The message of Kindness was empowering and the
connection they made with the audience was phenomenal and students
remained actively engaged throughout. Students loved their slide
presentation and the live music performed by their band. We look
forward to having them back again.&quot;

Mary Jacquart, Georges P. Vanier Junior High School


Your cost:  Live Different has taken significant measures to ensure as
many students as possible can be reached with this exciting program.
By operating on a donation-based pricing model, it gives all schools
the opportunity to partner with us.


This is the character development presentation that students, parents,
and teachers will thank you for bringing to your school! You&apos;ll capture
your students&apos; attention and transform them with a message that matters.


We will be in {!Lead.State} conducting assemblies this April and
would love the opportunity to visit your school.  We only have time
slots available for 10 schools in {!Lead.County__c} this year.    Please
contact us as soon as possible so your school won’t be disappointed.


Call our office at 866-432-4464 or email bookings@livedifferent.com
to discuss booking details.


We look forward to speaking with you
