    <subject>Dominican Republic - July 2-12: Payment Reminder and Important Information</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey everyone!



There&apos;s only a few more months left until our trip to Dominican Republic and I can&apos;t wait! I hope everyone is as excited as I am to find out more about which communities we will be working in and which families we will be building a for.



By now, everyone should have sent us their $300 deposit and signed Consent Package.



Please read below for important information.



Payment Reminder:

Your remaining balance is due in 2 weeks on May 1st. If you have any questions in regards to making your payment/donation, please do not hesitate to contact me.



Flight Information:

If you are flying into Toronto to meet us, please forward me your flight itinerary that your airlines have sent you. Please do not e-mail me with a copy and paste or typed out flight information, I need the actual itinerary from the airlines, thanks!



Travel Medical Insurance:

Live Different will be purchasing Travel Medical Insurance for all volunteers so do not worry about purchasing additional insurance.



Family Profiles:

The families we will be building for will be up on our website in a month, I will send out another e-mail with photos and bios as soon as we can.



Upon Arrival:
All volunteers fly into the Toronto Pearson International Airport and  our staff will pick them up. Once all our volunteers have arrived we  spend a night at the Travelodge Airport Hotel, Dixon Road, Mississauga (2 minutes from the airport). As a group, the next day, we fly to Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic.



Pick up and drop off:
Once you have booked your flights, please forward me your trip itinerary and I can add you to our bus shuttle. When you arrive at the Toronto airport, our staff will be at the gate wearing a    Live Different t-shirt and holding a Live Different Build sign, and you will    then be taken to the Travelodge hotel for the night.
Please keep in mind that there are other volunteers on this trip, so our staff will be doing airport shuttles all day, which is one reason why we don&apos;t leave for Dominican Republic until the  following day.

After we drop off the volunteers at the airport on their last day, they get  on their flight and they&apos;re on their own    from there on. All the  volunteers can be picked up on the other side   by  their parents or other  family members.



Accommodations:
We stay at a small and clean resort called Sosua by the Sea. It is located 10 minutes away from the Puerto Plata Airport in a town called Sosua. The rooms provided there can fit up to 4 people   in a room with 2 beds. There is a private pool and beach that is   accessible for all volunteers. There is a buffet-style dining hall that   we are able to transform into an event hall for all of our evening   activities. The hotel has security guards that monitor the resort at all   times to ensure our safety. Shower towels, beach towels, a safe with a   key, and bedding are all provided by the resort.



Transportation:
We hire bus drivers for transportation and they arrive every morning at the resort to take us to the communities we will be working in. The drivers are experienced drivers whom we have been working with since 2005, they have experience driving in Dominican Republic, as well as the legal  documents to drive these registered vehicles.

Communities We Work In:
Since 2005, we have developed very strong relationships with the communities that we work in. The communities know Live Different very well and we feel very safe at all times while working on our building sites.



Work Site Safety:
We require all volunteers to bring down closed toed shoes, a  hat/bandanna, water bottle, sunglasses, sunscreen, and leather work  gloves. This ensures that volunteers are as equipped for handling  equipment on the job sites.



Vaccinations and Medications:
We do not require that any of our volunteers receive any vaccinations or medications to go to any of the countries that we work in. But, we do suggest that every volunteer visit their family doctor or local medical clinic and decide on your own about taking any medications or vaccinations prior to the trip.



Excursion Day (trip specific):
There are a few options for the excursion day that our staff will decide on closer to the date of the trip (cascading, horse back riding, zip lining, kayaking). There will be a staff member supervising each group that will be going on an excursion. If volunteers   do not want to sign up for an excursion, they are welcome to stay back   at the resort with our staff members.



Contact during a trip between volunteers and Canada:
There is wifi available at the resort, a wifi code can be purchased at the front desk. Due to the fact that we will be using internet in a developing country, it will be hard for volunteers to receive a well enough connection skype with their family members, but   they can indeed use Facebook and e-mail. We also have a Facebook page   that we update every day to keep family and friends  informed. All of   our staff have cell phones on them at all times.We will be emailing   everyone all of the emergency  contact information before the trip   starts.



Have a great week!
