What others are saying
&quot;What has stood out for me the most about Constable Mason is his ability to relate well to youth and their families, frontline service providers, and the academic community. He is devoted to reducing bullying and restorative justice in a way that I have yet to see from any other police officer. I suspect it also has to do with the fact that Constable Mason is conscientious, caring, intelligent, and interpersonally skilled.&quot;
Tracy Vaillancourt Canada Research Chair, Children&apos;s Mental Health and Violence Prevention
&quot;I have personally seen the incredible impact that Johnny has made in his communication. His communications are always creative, engaging and full of humour. He is a pleasure to have and we look to book him every year as he connects so well with the audience. I would and have recommended Johnny to any organization that is looking for a passionate, talented and committed communicator for this next generation.&quot;
Alex Smethurst, Youth Worker, St. Catharines, ON
&quot;Christal consistently receives rave reviews from those in her workshops and has the ability to connect with everyone in the room. Not only is she phenomenal at giving a workshop presentation she is also amazing to work with.&quot;
Angela Cacciavillani, Ontario Student Leadership Conference Coordinator
