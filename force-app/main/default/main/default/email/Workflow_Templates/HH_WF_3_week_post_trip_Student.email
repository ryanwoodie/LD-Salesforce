<p>We hope you are doing well and all is going smoothly in your part of the world. It has been a while since we were together and we wanted to remind you that we haven't forgotten about you!</p>

<p>Now that there has been some time since you returned home from your Live Different Build, you may be wondering what's next. How can you continue to make a difference in the world around you when your own life is busy and full of its own challenges? Remember: start with what you see in front of you and figure out what matters to you the most.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Are there groups that have already been established in your school or on your campus that you could add your time and voice to?</li>
<li>Take a look around your community and city - what can you be a part of affecting change that you may have never considered before?</li>
<li>Get online, do some research, and sign up for human rights forums, advocacy petitions, and movements that resonate with you. Your voice matters!</li>
<li>Have you considered some form of monthly child sponsorship or monthly sponsorship with us here at Live Different? We can continue to work together!</li>
<li>If you are a writer or like to think big, why not blog, freelance, or even contact your local newspaper or magazines to share your experience?</li>
<li>Request your own school assembly to share your experience, invite others to join you again, or even just to help wake people up to what is going on in the world around them and how they can get involved in making a difference. Invite us to do our Motivational Production in your school and join us with your own participation!</li>
<li>Make sure to go back to anyone who supported you on your Live Different Build and share your stories and highlights with them. These people believed in you enough to help you on your trip, and they'd love to hear about the impact it had on you!</li>
<li>Try starting your own YouTube channel and create your own webisodes about what you are passionate about.</li>
<li>Tell everyone via Facebook, Twitter, and any other social networks you are into that they can find out how to change the world by talking to you!</li>
<li>Why not go big? Host your own conference or sessions at your school about what is happening globally and how your school can do something to change it! Contact us if you want more ideas.</li>
<li>Above all, don't stop dreaming up new ideas or give in to the same old routines and attitudes. You are different now - and different is great!
</ul>

<p>Your life is powerful because you have the opportunity to live differently every day. Now is the time for you to remember all the possibilities - no matter what you see in front of you, your choices can create change!</p>

<p>We would love to hear from you. Would you consider being a guest blogger with us on our website? Maybe you already have some videos that you have made or that someone has made about you. Let us know - we would love to promote what you are now doing back home. Don't be a stranger - please!</p>

<p>Thanks again for being part of a Live Different Build. We hope to see you again really soon - somewhere in the world!</p>
