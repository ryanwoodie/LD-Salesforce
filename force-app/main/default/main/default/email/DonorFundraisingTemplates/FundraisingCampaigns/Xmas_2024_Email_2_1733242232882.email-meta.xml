Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},

Today is Giving Tuesday—a global day of generosity and a chance to make a meaningful difference.

As you know, a huge part of what LiveDifferent does to inspire, empower, and engage youth in a lifestyle of compassion and kindness is through our Humanitarian Builds trips. Each year, youth from across Canada travel to communities in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, working side-by-side with local families to build safe, dignified homes.

We believe every Canadian youth deserves equal access to opportunities for growth that fuel their future success, regardless of background or circumstances. The Youth Scholarship Fundprovides students—including underserved and Indigenous youth—with a $500 bursary to help them reach their goals of joining a Build.

**Jordan’s Story
----------------------------------------------------

When Jordan Schwartz joined his first LiveDifferent Build as a high school student, he had no idea it would change his life.

“The culture shock was significant, but I realized how connected we are through shared values like family and community. That trip taught me empathy, teamwork, and the power of giving back—it was genuinely life-changing.”

Today, Jordan supports the Youth Scholarship Fund to help more students experience the transformation he did.

“Just a small boost can help a student start their journey and inspire others to join.”
