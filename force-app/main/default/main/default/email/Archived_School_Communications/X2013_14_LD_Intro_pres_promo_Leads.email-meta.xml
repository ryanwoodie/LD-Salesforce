    <subject>Live Different&apos;s Motivational Assembly - Reserve now for 2013/2014</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!if(Contact.FirstName!=&quot;&quot;,Contact.FirstName,Lead.FirstName)},

My name is {!User.FirstName}, and I am part of an organization called Live Different. We are a registered Canadian Charity that has been offering our highly recommended motivational presentations in schools and leadership conferences across Canada for the past 12 years.


We have not yet had the privilege of visiting your school, but would love the opportunity to do so!


Our high energy production is designed to leave youth hanging off of every laugh inducing, life-inspiring word. Through live music, media, and the power of personal story, we focus on core issues to inspire change from within.


Our goal is to engage students both practically and emotionally with the idea that they have the incredible ability to make an impact on the world around them. We hope to create a shift in the culture of your school, where you see more students engaged, involved, and acting out a lifestyle that cares for others.




What others are saying

&quot;I was completely amazed by the fast-paced, hard hitting personal stories, videos, music and skits that dealt with many sensitive issues that affect young people.&quot;

Gordon L. Barnhart ~ Former Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan

&quot;The presentation itself was designed extremely well for the audience it is intended to impact. The message was clear and impactful and the entertainment provided was first class.&quot;

Terry Grady ~ BC Principal

&quot;In today&apos;s&apos; school system our youth is challenged with many issues in our society. &quot;Live Different&quot; presents these issues with real life experiences and honesty. Our students can relate to their message.&quot;

Danny Berry ~ Principal - Sherbrooke, NS
