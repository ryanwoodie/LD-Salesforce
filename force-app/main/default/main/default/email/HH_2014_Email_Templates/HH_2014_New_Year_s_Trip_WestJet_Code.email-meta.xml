    <subject>Live Different: WestJet Discount Code - Book Your Flights!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey Everyone!

I just wanted to send our an email to let all of you know that WestJet has officially given Live Different volunteers a way to save on flights when travelling for a Live Different Build trip.

Please read all of the information carefully before booking!

WestJet Discount
There is a potential 10% discount on flights depending on where you are travelling from and to as well as availability. The sooner you call, the better the discounts are.

How to Received a Discount
We have a discount code for any flights booked through WestJet! The convention code is only for individual flights. When you use it, you have to call the WestJet Groups Department at 1-888-493-7853 and give them the convention code: CC7946.

On the phone: &quot;Hi there, I am hoping to book an individual flight using the convention code: CC7946 to go on a Live Different Build trip.&quot;

Forwarding the Itinerary
Please call as soon as possible to book your flights if you wish to receive a discount. Once you have your flights booked, please forward me your flight itinerary!

Extra Nights
If you are arriving a day early or staying a day later because of flight availability, you are welcome to stay at the resort and I can book you for an extra night. It is $42 USD per night (all inclusive) for a shared room and $60 USD per night (all inclusive) for a private room.

If you have questions, please let me know.
