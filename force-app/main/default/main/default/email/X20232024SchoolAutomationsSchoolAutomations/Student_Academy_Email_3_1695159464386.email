<p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, ðŸŒŸ</p>

<p>Hope you&#39;re enjoying a sunny and warm week! ðŸ¤™</p>

<p>Ever wondered what it&#39;s like to be part of LiveDifferent&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="https://livedifferent.com/programs/academy/" target="_blank">Academy Program</a>? Imagine learning about global issues, building homes for families in need, and making lifelong friends&mdash;all while traveling across three beautiful countries!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t just take our word for it, hear what a recent participant had to say:</p>

<p><em>&quot;It is important to know that this experience will change you. You can&#39;t go through an experience like this without letting it alter your way of thinking and viewing the world. The best advice I could share with you is this. &#39;Do something each day that makes you a little uncomfortable.&#39;&quot;</em></p>

<p>Stay curious,</p>

<p>Tyler ðŸš€</p>
