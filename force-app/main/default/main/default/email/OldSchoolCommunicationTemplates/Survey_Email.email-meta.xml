    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Survey_Name__c},



It is hard to believe one week has already passed since your Think Day! We hope the experience went smoothly for you and that you have already seen positive results in the lives of your students. I wanted to ask a small favour of you. At Absolute, we strive to take any opportunity to improve on what we do in order to make our services more enjoyable for you, and more effective for the students. There is a link below that will take you to an online survey. It will take no more than a minute or two of your time, but you will be helping us out greatly.
