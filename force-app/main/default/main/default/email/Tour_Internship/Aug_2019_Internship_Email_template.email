<p>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>My name is Jon Peters and I manage the road teams at Live Different. I am reaching out to you as one of our past Build trip alumni, as I want to bring another opportunity to your attention: our Canadian school tours!</p>
<p>We have three teams of&nbsp;young adults (5 to 6 per team)&nbsp;that&nbsp;travel&nbsp;across&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;speaking in middle schools and high schools, empowering students to live a lifestyle of compassion and service. These are one-hour &lsquo;rock show style&rsquo; presentations with live music, lights, video screens and personal story-telling (students don't fall asleep during these assemblies, haha&nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>We have two opportunties available:</p>
<p>1. We are now accepting applications for our spring 2020 tour (Jan 18 to May 22, 2020).</p>
<p>2. We still have room for 1 or 2 last minute additions to our fall 2019 tour (Aug 18 to Dec 13, 2019).</p>
<p>Some info:<br />- This is a free (volunteer) opportunity.&nbsp;Expenses are covered, including&nbsp;flights to bring you to&nbsp;Hamilton to train and start the tour!<br />- <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>To apply:&nbsp;</strong></span><a href="https://bit.ly/2TaVhfY">click here</a> for a PDF summary/application link.<br />- Webpage:&nbsp;<a href="https://livedifferent.%20com/tour-internship/">https://livedifferent. com/tour-internship/</a></p>
<p>I would love to answer any questions you might have, please&nbsp;call/text&nbsp;my cell 289-683-4100 anytime, or reply to this email.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your past contributions, and thank you in advance for considering this opportunity.</p>
