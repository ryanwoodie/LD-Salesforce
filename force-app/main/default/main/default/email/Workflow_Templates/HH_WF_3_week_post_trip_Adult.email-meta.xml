Hey there, remember us?

It&apos;s now been a few weeks since we wrapped up our Live Different Build experience together, but that doesn&apos;t mean we have forgotten all that we were able to accomplish together. Thanks again for joining us on a Live Different Build and for using your energy, resources and time to be a part of something that brought hope and change.

We realize that life is back in full capacity for you again, but have you thought about what you want to change or do as a result of your Live Different Build? There are endless ways to get out there and be a part of something, and you know best what it is you are most passionate about. However, we wanted to give you a few ideas from our perspective, just in case you needed a kick start.

Are you a writer or are you at least able to string sentences together successfully? Then why not write a guest blog for us on our website about your experience? You can also do editorial submissions to your local papers, magazines, etc. that would highlight your experience and give you the chance to reach out to other people in your community with a message that change is possible.

Have you looked into what the local organizations are that you can add your energy and voice to? If there is something missing, then maybe you are the perfect person to fill it and start your own thing. Advocacy and awareness are a great way to expand your perspective and influence those around you who may not have yet had the same opportunity as you to do something.

Help us get into the schools in your area! We want to reach as many students with the message of hope as possible, and we need your help. To find out more info, email us at bookings@livedifferent.com. The world needs your voice, but your resources also help make things happen! Do you have gifts, talents, time or money that you can give to help Live Different or other organizations that you are passionate about?

Remember: the time is always right to do good - so get out there and do something! To find out how you can continue to help us help the world, remember to follow our Facebook page and to check out www.livedifferent.com.

Again, thanks for being a part of a Live Different Build. The experiences, the memories and the friendships that you have built during your time with us will continue to live on, and your life has left an impression on people that won&apos;t be forgotten.

Thanks for everything!
