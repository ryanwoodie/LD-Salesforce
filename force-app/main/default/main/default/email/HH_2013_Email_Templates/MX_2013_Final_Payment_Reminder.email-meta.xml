    <textOnly>Happy Wednesday!

I hope everyone is ready for an amazing long weekend ahead of us. From the looks of it, it will be a hot and sunny weekend for those who live in the Greater Toronto Area, hopefully everyone else will be just as lucky!

This is just a quick reminder that your final payment is coming up in 2 weeks on June 1st, 2013. By now, everyone should have already made a $300 deposit to secure a spot on the trip.

If you are wondering how much you have in your account, please respond to this e-mail and I will be able to help you.

Have an awesome long weekend everyone!

Sincerely,

Joy Yu</textOnly>
