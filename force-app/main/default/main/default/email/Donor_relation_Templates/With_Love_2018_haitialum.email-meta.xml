    <subject>You are invited to our 2018 &apos;With Love&apos; Gala in Winnipeg!</subject>
    <textOnly>Summer is here and the students at our school, Ecole L’Union, in Haiti are on summer break. While in Haiti, you probably remember visiting a plot of land that would be one day used as a home for children rescued from restavek (bonded labour).

Here at Live Different headquarters, we’re working hard behind the scenes on our upcoming fundraising gala. We have big plans for that plot of land to expand our work in Haiti beyond education into helping combat the trafficking of young girls and the gala will play a significant role in creating more awareness and raising support.

Our “With Love” gala is happening on October 4th at the Canadian Museum of Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and will benefit both the work we do in Haiti and here at home in Canada! It’s an evening of great food, entertainment, and important stories, helping to combat the exploitation of young girls in Haiti and providing students across Canada with positive messages of hope, encouragement, and purpose.

If it’s possible, we’d love to have you join us for this special occasion. For more information on purchasing individual tickets or a table, visit livedifferent.com/with-love-gala.

Thank you for your continued support of the life-changing work!

All the best,
