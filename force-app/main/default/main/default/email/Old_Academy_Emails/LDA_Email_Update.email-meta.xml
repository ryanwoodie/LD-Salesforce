It gives an explanation of who Live Different is and what the Live  Different Academy is all about. It is a good idea to include a personal  letter from yourself too. One that explains why you want to participant  in the program and what you hope to accomplish.
Payment-Donation Form - any donations (ie. cheques) you receive from others MUST be accompanied  by one of these forms in order to establish whether they are making a  payment or giving a donation. An explanation of each option is clearly  outlined on the form. Please print several copies of the attached form,  or send people to the following online link: http://livedifferent.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Academy_payment.pdf

10. STUDENT HANDBOOK

You will be receiving your Student Handbook in the spring, along with packing lists. We will not be making the decision  regarding who goes to Mexico first and who tours with the motivational  production until June, as the decision is based largely on the number or  students and the strengths/personalities of the students accepted to  the Academy. Thank you in advance for your patience.

Please feel free to call or email me at any time go over more information with you and to answer any questions that you or your parents may have about the Academy. I am always available to you at the contact information below. Please do not be shy in calling or emailing; if you don&apos;t know, just ask. I&apos;m here to help.
