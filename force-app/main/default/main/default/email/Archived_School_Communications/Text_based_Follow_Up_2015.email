Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

I hope you're doing well.  Earlier this month I sent some information regarding our exciting motivational and character education presentations and the possibility of visiting your school this year.  Have you had a chance to consider this opportunity?  I still have a number of available dates that might work well for your schedule, so let's reserve one now!

We'd love to help positively impact your students' year and better support your school's staff, so if you have any questions what so ever, please send them my way.  I'll be happy to help!

Thanks so much.  I look forward to hearing from you soon!

All the best,
