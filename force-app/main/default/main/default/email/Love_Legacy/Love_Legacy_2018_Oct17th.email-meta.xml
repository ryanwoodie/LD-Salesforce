Today is a day of remembrance and reflection for our Live Different family, as October 17th marks the anniversary of the tragic passing of our good friend Benjamin Cole Brown.

With the support of people like you, a lot has happened since then and today is now also a time of hope and renewed passion to continue living lives of compassion. As Cole so wisely said “Get a purpose and a cause in your heart and say ‘what can my life do, what can I accomplish?’

Choosing to answer that question with actions, not words, Benjamin Cole bettered the lives of countless people and has inspired many others to do the same.

In our presentation last year, we played a video that spoke to Cole&apos;s legacy. Click the link below to view it.

Thank you for supporting #LoveLegacy, and ultimately, the children.
