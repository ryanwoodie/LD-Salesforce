    <subject>The presentation that students, parents, and teachers will thank you for bringing to your school</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you&apos;re doing well and getting excited for the upcoming school year. We haven&apos;t had the pleasure of partnering with you for some time now, so as you plan for this year and look to motivate and inspire your students, please consider what our presentation team has to offer.

As a reminder of what we do, here is a quick introduction video: https://youtu.be/mGWCT8IS1Oo

Below, I&apos;ve included more information regarding our theme and goals for this school year. If you have any questions as you consider booking a motivational presentation, please let me know. I&apos;ll be happy to help!

Thanks so much {!Contact.FirstName}. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

All the best,

Hour-long School Presentation  Empowering Life Stories Inspiring Videos  Live Band   Grades 6 &amp; up

This is the character development presentation that students, parents, and teachers will thank you for bringing to your school! You&apos;ll capture your students&apos; attention and transform them with a message that matters.

Trusted by Canadian schools for over 16 years

We&apos;ve presented to over 1.1 Million students in 2,300 schools over the last 15 years.

After experiencing a Live Different presentation, 98% of educators rank it better than other presentations they have had in their school.

--------------------------------
What makes our presentations different?

Most programs lecture on outward behaviors/symptoms (which research shows can be counter-productive). Our positive approach cuts through to root causes and mindsets, igniting change from within.

The true impact of our presentation comes from the power of the personal story. Young people, sharing their stories of hope, connect with students like nothing else.

Our upbeat, high energy concert-style presentation keeps students fully engaged and tuned-in to a message that will change their life.

Our messaging will spark meaningful discussions across your student body, inspiring students that need help to reach out.

What others are saying

&quot;I&apos;m not sure how the presentation could be improved- it was absolutely amazing! I heard comments like &apos;That&apos;s the best presentation I have seen in my entire teaching career&apos; from a veteran teacher, and students were raving about it for days. It was very worthwhile and inspirational.&quot;
Jo&apos;ann Obrien, St James Regional High School

&quot;In my 17 years in education this is the best loved student assembly I have ever been to. Students were literally hugging me in thanks for bringing LIVE DIFFERENT in.&quot;
Lorna Cameron, E.W. Pratt High School

&quot;Finally a presentation that gets it right.  The perfect mix of a meaningful message presented in a fun and entertaining way.  I&apos;m looking forward to having them back next year!&quot;
Gary Watson, Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School
