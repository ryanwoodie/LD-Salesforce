<p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);">I hope you’re having a great week so far!</span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);">I know how busy things can get, but don’t worry, there are still a few dates to book a LiveDifferent Assembly during Mental Health Month in May.&nbsp; I want to ensure we can save a date for your school, so let me know if you'd like to reserve one.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);">By booking a LiveDifferent Assembly you’re allowing your students to hear from other young adults who have overcome adversity and offer a message of hope and resilience. I understand the critical role educators play in shaping student’s lives, and I’m excited about the prospect of collaborating with you to help support your students.</span></p>

<p>Could we set up a quick call or discuss available dates via email at your convenience? Just click<a href="https://calendar.app.google/YkSHZ7uDDaPF54536" target="_blank"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);"> HERE</span></a>.</p>

Warm regards,<br />
