Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope your spring is going well! I am getting in touch with all our Live Different Consultants to give you an update on where planning is at for next year&apos;s school presentation, and get further feedback.  Thank you SO MUCH for your ongoing support and help. So many students have been impacted this year because of the program improvements resulting from the input our consultants provided last spring and fall - I cannot emphasize enough how critically valuable your help is.

We sent an initial survey to our consultants and other educators a few weeks ago to get input on what issues and challenges they feel students are currently facing. The following link gives a sneak peak at where our 2015-16 message is headed and the opportunity for feedback on it:

If you feel you don&apos;t have the time to fill the survey, I would even appreciate a quick reply to acknowledge you received this email (we are curious if there were email delivery issues on our previous correspondence). If you have any questions or concerns, or would rather give your input directly or verbally, please feel free to call or email me anytime.

Kindest Regards,

Ryan Wood
