Hi there!  This is Dave Hamilton from Live Different, reminding you of your plans to attend the Live Different motivational assembly at {!Account.Name}, on {!BP_Store_Invite__c.Date__c} at {!BP_Store_Invite__c.Presentation_Time_Formula__c}. The school&apos;s address is {!Account.BillingAddress}.

The team and the school are both aware that you plan on attending and will keep an eye out for you when you arrive. When you get there, please check in at the main office (preferably 15 minutes or so before the start time of the presentation) and they will give you instructions on where you&apos;ll be able to find the team. 

If you have any questions at all about this event, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks so much,

Dave Hamilton
