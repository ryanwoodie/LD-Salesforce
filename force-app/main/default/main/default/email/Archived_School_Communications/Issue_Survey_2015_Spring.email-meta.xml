    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Here at Live Different, we are currently putting together our school presentation programming for the 2015/2016 year, and we would like to offer you the opportunity to give some input into what sort of issues and initiatives would be the most relevant to your students.

If you&apos;re interested in providing some advice, suggestions, and ideas, please click on the button below to be taken to a short questionnaire.

Thank you so much for feedback, we take it to heart, and it really does help us improve the charitable student empowerment work that we do here at Live Different!



Take me to the questionnaire!
