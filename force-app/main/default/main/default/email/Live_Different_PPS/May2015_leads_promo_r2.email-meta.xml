Hi,

My name is {!User.FirstName}, and I am a School Liaison with Live Different. We&apos;ve worked with thousands of schools across Canada but have not yet had the pleasure of partnering with {!Account.Name}. We&apos;d love the opportunity to visit your school, so I thought I would give you a little information about who we are and the exciting things we have to offer your school. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I&apos;d be glad to help!

Hour-long School Presentation  Empowering Life Stories Inspiring Videos  Live Band   Grades 7 &amp; up

This is the character development presentation that students, parents, and teachers will thank you for bringing to your school! You&apos;ll capture your students&apos; attention and transform them with a message that matters.

Trusted by Canadian schools for over 16 years

We&apos;ve presented to over 1.1 Million students in 2,300 schools over the last 15 years.

After experiencing a Live Different presentation, 98% of educators rank it better than other presentations they have had in their school.

What makes our presentations different?

Most programs lecture on outward behaviors/symptoms (which research shows can be counter-productive). Our positive approach cuts through to root causes and mindsets, igniting change from within.

The true impact of our presentation comes from the power of the personal story. Young people, sharing their stories of hope, connect with students like nothing else.

Our upbeat, high energy concert-style presentation keeps students fully engaged and tuned-in to a message that will change their life.

Our messaging will spark meaningful discussions across your student body, inspiring students that need help to reach out.

What others are saying

&quot;I&apos;m not sure how the presentation could be improved- it was absolutely amazing! I heard comments like &apos;That&apos;s the best presentation I have seen in my entire teaching career&apos; from a veteran teacher, and students were raving about it for days. It was very worthwhile and inspirational.&quot;
Jo&apos;ann Obrien, St James Regional High School

&quot;In my 17 years in education this is the best loved student assembly I have ever been to. Students were literally hugging me in thanks for bringing LIVE DIFFERENT in.&quot;
Lorna Cameron, E.W. Pratt High School

&quot;Finally a presentation that gets it right.  The perfect mix of a meaningful message presented in a fun and entertaining way.  I&apos;m looking forward to having them back next year!&quot;
Gary Watson, Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School
