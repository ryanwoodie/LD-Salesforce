    <textOnly>Hey everyone!

I am so excited to introduce to your our Summer Interns of 2013. These individuals have completed a 3 month long application process since September and were carefully selected in December of 2012. Since January of 2013, they have been working on different projects and assignments before they join us down in Dominican Republic for the month of July to host both our public trips. They have been educating themselves to be a knowledgeable leader and I can&apos;t wait for our all of you to meet them!

Here are a few things that the Summer Interns will be assisting our staff with during the summer:

Registration
Airport Shuttles
Team Leading
Daily Preparation
General Hosting
MCing and Hosting Evening Activities
Job Site Moral
Basic Security
Soritng Donations
General Maintenance

The most important part of their job, is being there for you and making sure that everyone is well taken care of!

Please check out their bios and what they have to say about what being an intern means to them. As well, you can check out some of the projects they have been working on under &quot;Media and Blog&quot;.
