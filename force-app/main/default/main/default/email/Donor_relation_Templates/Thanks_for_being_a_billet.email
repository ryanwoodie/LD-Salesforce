Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

On behalf of our staff, volunteers, and the thousands of lives that will be affected by our programs this year, we would like to say a huge thank you for your recent participation on a Live Different Build, and for your interest in billeting for Live Different! 

It it such a gift to our teams to have a warm and welcoming place to call home while they're on the road, even if for only one night or a few days! They greatly value the chance to get to know our supporters all over the country, to be shown around your home town, and to even just  to have a home-cooked meal and do some laundry! 

Again, thanks so much for your support, we're excited for the chance to visit you in the near future! Live Different believes in open, transparent communication with our partners and we welcome your input, questions, or comments. Please feel free to either call our office at 1-866-432-4464 or email me at cindy@livedifferent.com. 

Sincerely,
