    <subject>An exciting update for Ecole L&apos;Union!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Yesterday was a very exciting day for #LoveLegacy. Benjamin Cole Brown’s parents were on hand to see the very first lunch being provided to our students out of the school’s new kitchen and our goal, as #LoveLegacy support continues to grow, is to expand this nutrition program to every day the students are in school.  Nutrition plays a massive role in the growth and development of children and we’re extremely excited to see friends and family of Live Different helping to make this a reality.


Live Different is grateful for your support, as it truly is making a huge difference in the lives of the students and the community.  Another way you can help is to share #LoveLegacy with friends and family who might be interested in getting involved.  Together, we can help Benjamin Cole Brown’s dreams for these children be realized.
