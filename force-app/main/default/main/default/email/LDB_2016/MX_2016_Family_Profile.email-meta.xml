    <textOnly>Hi everyone!

Here are the links to the family profiles.

Please take the time to read it over. It is so special to build a connection with the families you will be building for. It will be a relationship like no other and I hope that you take the time to get to know the families when you meet them. Building the house is important, but building relationships is more meaningful! Make sure you take the time to hangout with them on the work sites.

Can&apos;t wait to hear stories!
