<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
I hope you’re doing well!</p>

<p>It’s gift-giving season, so I was&nbsp;wondering if you can&nbsp;help us give something really nice to your amazing team of educators.</p>

<p>Students are obviously the main focus of&nbsp;what LiveDifferent does, having&nbsp;launched a pandemic-proof program to help them stay connected and inspired this year, but along the way, we realized that the format and sessions work really well with adult groups too!</p>

<p>In short, we’d love&nbsp;to offer your group of educators a 60-minute, virtual professional development and team building opportunity for&nbsp;<u><b>FREE</b></u>. (&lt;--- yes, for FREE!)</p>

<p>Recently, a social worker we partnered with in British Columbia experienced the very same session and told us just how impactful an event it was, saying that we shouldn’t “underestimate how meaningful this experience is for adults”. So, with that in mind, we want to give back to educators who have been giving so much of themselves this year.&nbsp;To book your&nbsp;free professional development session, or to learn more about how we’re supporting schools, check things out over at&nbsp;<a href="https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-pd-day/">https://livedifferent.com/circles/circles-pd-day/</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Let’s do something really special for your team!</p>

<p>Thanks so much {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;</p>
