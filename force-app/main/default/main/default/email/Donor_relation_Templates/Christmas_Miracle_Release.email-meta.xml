By now, you&apos;ve probably seen WestJet&apos;s Spirit of Giving video. (If you haven&apos;t had a chance to view it yet, take a moment to watch it below. It&apos;s inspiring, heartfelt, and might just bring up some tears of joy!)


We at Live Different love the heart behind this year&apos;s WestJet Christmas Miracle, and we couldn&apos;t be more proud of how they connected with us and the local community in a way that was humble, caring, and respectful. By consulting directly with the community leaders to identify the families and individuals who had the greatest need, WestJet&apos;s community investment team ensured that those who really were wishing for a miracle this Christmas actually received one. In addition, by hosting their Winter Wonderland Party, and gifting the community with a safe, accessible playground, WestJet provided a way for all of the residents of Nuevo Renacer to benefit from this year&apos;s Christmas Miracle.
