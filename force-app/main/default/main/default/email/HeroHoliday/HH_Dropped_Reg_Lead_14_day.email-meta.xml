    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName}!

Long time no see!

A couple weeks ago, you started filling out a registration form to come on a Live Different Build, but for some reason you didn&apos;t finish filling it out. If you are still interested in volunteering to help vulnerable people in desperate need, and having a life changing experience at the same time, we would love to help you complete it!

Do you have any questions, or is there anything we can help with? Please give us a call, or simply reply to this email.

We look forward to hearing from you!&lt;?p&gt;

Thanks,

{!Lead.OwnerFullName}
