Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

My name is Cindy, and I&apos;m the Community Engagement Coordinator for Live Different - that means I&apos;m here to help you stay connected with us and everything we do!

As you and your fellow Oak Bay High School students and staff recently volunteered on a Build in Mexico, you&apos;ve been a part of the huge impact that Live Different&apos;s projects have on the communities that we partner with. One of these projects that your school supported, the new Trades Learning Centre, will help us provide much-needed skills training for people from the community, teaching them woodworking, masonry, and welding. These valuable trade skills will equip them to have much better opportunities for employment in the future.

This centre will also help us make the furniture that goes into each house that Live Different builds. Being able to outfit our families with good quality furnishings while at the same time, providing training for local people in the community is a &quot;win-win&quot; situation for everyone involved!

We&apos;re excited to share that thanks to Oak Bay&apos;s generous donation of $7900, we&apos;re halfway to our fundraising goal to build the Trades Learning Centre! We&apos;re so grateful for the support that Oak Bay has provided for our programs and partners in Mexico. We appreciate the hard work your group puts into fundraising each year, not only so that your students can volunteer on a Build, but also contribute in many other meaningful ways like this.
