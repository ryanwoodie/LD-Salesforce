Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

This past school year, demand for our Live Different school presentations was very high and dates filled up quickly. Before sending out our 2014-15 information to schools across Canada, we wanted to reach out to the schools and educators we have worked with over the past few years and give you advance notice on tour dates and our presentation theme.

Some possible dates that we will be available in the {!Account.BillingCity} area in 2014/15 are:

Following is a sneak peak at our 2014-15 presentation theme. We are very excited about this program and the change it will affect in your students and school!

Unlock your students&apos; courage to grow, to stand, and to care.

Our 2014/2015 presentation will help your students discover and embrace their ability to overcome negative mindsets, pressures, and group norms, and start to connect in meaningful ways, caring authentically for those around them.


Students will discover what true courage means and how to live it out through:


Character

Life isn&apos;t about keeping up appearances or living up to labels, it&apos;s about learning and growing. How to cultivate a self-concept (ie. growth mindset) that gives us the resiliency to embrace and grow from life&apos;s challenges, and find help along the way.


Confidence

Conforming to harmful or superficial social norms is very easy, but it can side-track us from the things that really matter. How to recognize and resist negative group pressures and our automatic behaviors in favour of meaningful priorities.


Connection

In a digital world with so many distractions, real relationship is still what we are wired for. How to start connecting with the people in our lives in caring and authentic ways

What others said about our 2013/2014 presentation
&quot;The Live Different presentation was a powerful experience for both staff and students. The message of Kindness was empowering and the connection they made with the audience was phenomenal and students remained actively engaged throughout. Students loved their slide presentation and the live music performed by their band. We look forward to having them back again.&quot;
Mary Jacquart, Principal Georges P. Vanier Junior High School
&quot;I&apos;m not sure how the presentation could be improved- it was absolutely amazing! I heard comments like &apos;That&apos;s the best presentation I have seen in my entire teaching career&apos; from a veteran teacher, and students were raving about it for days. It was very worthwhile and inspirational.&quot;
JoAnn O&apos;Brien, Guidance Counsellor, St. James Regional High School
&quot;Thank you so much for the amazing, energizing, and inspiring assembly.  The students are STILL talking about it.  Such a clear, simple message.  Kindness DOES change everything! We will definitely have you back!&quot;
Christine Alexopoulos, Student Council Advisor Unionville High School
