<p>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}&#33;</p>

<p>Seasons Greetings!. This is Charles Roberts here from Live Different. I am reaching out to you as you have supported Live Different or our Live Different Build in the past, or have subscribed to our mailing list.</p>

<p>In 2012, Live Different volunteers built 55 houses for amazing families in Mexico and Dominican Republic, and helped shape the future for hundreds of children in Haiti and Thailand through education and building projects. We also had the opportunity to visit hundreds of schools all across Canada, and had the pleasure of mentoring students in our Live Different Academy. Your support helped to make all of this happen, and we would like to say thank you!</p>

<p>Live Different exists to inspire a lifestyle that cares for people, not stuff. This message is especially important during the Holiday season. In our culture, there is an expectation for each of us to search high and low for the latest invention or 'coolest' gift for those closest to us. The dilemma is that most of us don't really need anything, and this time of year plays on our desires to fulfill our wants.  Here at Live Different, we are constantly challenging ourselves to prioritize the needs of others over our personal wants and we would love for you to join with us this Holiday Season!  In our culture where it is normal to spend over 400 Billion Dollars on gifts each year, it's time to challenge ourselves and each other to Give Different!</p>

<p>This year, you can Give Different by giving a meaningful and valuable gift, like a hamper of groceries or even a new house, to those who need it most. Here is how to help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to our Give Different page and donate. You can optionally dedicate donations in honour of loved ones, and our CanadaHelps donation page can send them an E-card to tell them about the meaningful gift you made in their honour. Makes Christmas shopping easier as people love to receive this in lieu of traditional presents!</li>

<li>Or you can "Wish Different", by creating your own GivingPage (which only takes 2 minutes), and letting your friends and family know that you'd like them to Give Different and help an incredible family as their gift to you!</li></ol></p>

<p>Each gift, big or small, will help to make a difference in the communities we work in. Thanks, and from all of us at Live Different, Happy Holidays</p>
