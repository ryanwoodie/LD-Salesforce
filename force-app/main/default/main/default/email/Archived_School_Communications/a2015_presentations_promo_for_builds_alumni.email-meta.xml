Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!


Following your recent Build trip, you noted on your survey that you&apos;d like to have a Live Different Presentation in your community. That&apos;s awesome! Our teams would love to visit the local schools in your area this year, and you can help make that happen! The information below can be forwarded on to Principals, Guidance Counselors, Leadership Teachers, and any other staff members you think might be interested in having us visit their school. It also helps if you add your own endorsement, having just been part of what Live Different is all about!


Thank you very much!


Live Different Team

This year&apos;s theme will encourage your students to shift from being a passive spectator of their life story to being the author of it - creating a sense of identity, ownership, and hope for the future.

Identity
Students will embrace a positive self identity through an understanding of personal self worth by fighting the negativity bias.

Ownership
Students will gain the ability to see failures and challenges as opportunities to grow, while taking ownership of the decisions that affect their lives.

Potential
Students will visualize the type of person they can become, and the ability they have to change the lives of those around them.

&quot;Finally a presentation that gets it right.  The perfect mix of a meaningful message presented in a fun and entertaining way.  I&apos;m looking forward to having them back next year!&quot;
