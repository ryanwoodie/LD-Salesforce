Absolute Leadership Development is a non-profit organization that exists to help students realize their incredible value and potential, and empower them to change their world. Our high school teams have traveled in every province in Canada and have spoken to over 600,000 students to date. 

For 2005/2006, our new &quot;Everyday Heroes&quot; tour will inspire your students to become &quot;heroes to themselves, to others and to their world&quot;. The content of this 1 hour presentation focuses around current teen issues,

bullying

sex

but every topic covered is embedded with a message of purpose. Much more than just a screen or a speech, our message actually gets through to the audience because it is presented in way that is relevant to this generation:

live professional band 

real people sharing their personal stories

light show

multi-media

comedy and crowd interaction

Please contact us to book this motivational experience at your school!


Absolute Motivational Experience - an annual mainstage presention at the Canadian Student Leadership Conference (Abbortsford BC 2004, Llyodminster SK 2005, and invited back for 2006 at Fredricton NB) 

&quot;The show I attended was dynamic and engaging, but more importantly it was amazing to see how receptive the teens wereâ€¦ It is a pleasure to find an organization so committed to helping teens with real issuesâ€¦â€�

Lorraine Zander, Publisher &amp; Editor-in-Chief, FAZE magazine, Canada&apos;s largest teen publicaton 

â€œAbsolutely entertaining, absolutely engaging, absolutely relevantâ€¦ The buzz around school since your performance is unparalleledâ€¦ I highly recommend you for any high school audience in the country.â€� 

Randy Gallant, Vice-Principal, Three Oaks Senior High, Summerside PEI

â€œYou delivered a very positive message about self-esteem, acceptance and hope without talking down to the studentsâ€¦ Not only did Absolute put on a fantastic show, but spent the extra time to show students that Absolute really cares.â€�

Ellen Hinan, Teacher, Lakefield District Secondary School, Lakefield ON

â€œStudents from our entire division applauded every second of this action-packed presentation. It wasnâ€™t preachy and it wasnâ€™t boring. It was a jam-packed presentation with a powerful messageâ€¦ We would highly recommend this group for any high school looking for a performance that will have a lasting impact on its students.â€�
