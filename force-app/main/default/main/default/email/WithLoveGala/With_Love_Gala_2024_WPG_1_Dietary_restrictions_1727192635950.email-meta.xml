    <textOnly>Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},

We’re just one week away from the With Love Gala, and we couldn’t be more excited. This special evening promises to be filled with inspiring moments, all in support of our impactful youth programming in Canada and Haiti.

We look forward to celebrating with you and sharing the incredible work that’s made possible thanks to your generosity and support.

Cocktail reception

We are going to kick things off with a cocktail reception at 6 pm. The bars in Buhler Hall and the lounge will be open and there will be live music on the main stage to enjoy (this year, we will be keeping the cocktail reception on the first level and we will not be walking up to the Garden of Contemplation).

Menu and dietary restrictions

We will be enjoying a delicious chicken breast wellington with brie cheese and cranberry sauce served with potato pave and Chef’s seasonal vegetables.

If you have dietary restrictions, please fill out this form &lt; https://livediff.typeform.com/to/s1WAvz8h?typeform-source=www.google.com &gt; by Sunday evening, September 29th. 

After-party

Get ready for a live DJ, specialty cocktails, a mac and cheese bar, and a poutine bar! The fun continues late into the night from 10 pm - 12 am. The after-party is brought to you by Tito’s Vodka and Marcia Bergen Group. 

MC and live auction

Ace Burpee will be returning as our emcee. We’re excited to offer an exclusive live auction featuring incredible experiences (more details on these exciting packages coming soon).
