 July Newsletter
 
 Hello {!Contact.FirstName}!

I have been thinking a lot about what hope and change looks like these days. For our Live Different Build participants it may mean the sense of accomplishment they now feel as they look back and realize what they are were a part of and what they can continue to do now that they are home. For our staff it looks like choosing daily to continue to work, dream and envision what we can continue to do to reach as many lives as possible. And for you, our philanthropic partners, it may mean continuing to believe that we are making a difference together. There are so many ways that each of us can connect and express our desire to make a difference around the world - even in our own back yards.


I bet you were just thinking, &quot;I wonder what has been happening in Absolute this month?&quot;

Well, the good news is that I would love to bring you up to speed!

July is always a super busy month in our world. As our booking team wraps up back in Canada and gears up for the new school year, Live Different Build is happening in both Mexico and Dominican Republic. In each location we have had some amazing people helping out with some amazing projects.

This past month in Mexico, thanks to the help of Scouts Canada and Grace Baptist Church, we were able to get some deserving families in homes that were needed. And in Dominican Republic, we had an amazing July with all of our participants, interns and staff. Together, we built 6 homes for families that have both touched our hearts and challenged our way of viewing the world around us. One of our interns, Claire, shares some of her thoughts on what it means to be a part of hope and change.

We also need to give a big shout out to all of our philanthropic partners who willingly opened up their homes to host our donor parties. As our CEO, Vaden, continues to travel across Canada inviting people to join with us to shape history, we are all encouraged and excited about how many great people there are out there. You are one of them, and together we are building something that has unlimited potential for the future. Thanks!

This past month we were privileged to have many unsung heroes who helped to bring tangible hope and provision to many families in Dominican Republic and Mexico. Some of the students who joined us had lost their own homes in recent forest fires in Northern Canada. Some of them had come from backgrounds and family histories that spoke of pain and loss. Some of them were just normal people trying to connect with someone else and make a difference in whatever way they could. All of them were heroic in their own way, and all of them deserve to be celebrated and thanked. Our staff has had the honour of working shoulder to shoulder with them this summer and every day they are a consistent, compassionate reminder of why we do what we do: because we believe in the limitless power of this generation and their lives are living proof of how powerful each of us can be when we are willing to just step out and try.

Thanks for continuing to believe in us and to support us through your financial and personal support - together we are making a difference each and every day!
