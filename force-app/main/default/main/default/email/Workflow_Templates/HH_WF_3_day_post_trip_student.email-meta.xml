Hey, long time no see!

We hope that you have been able to get some rest now that you are home and back in your version of the &apos;real&apos; world. However, if you are anything like us, there will be a big adjustment now that you are home, and we wanted to let you know that we have been there. We totally get it.

Don&apos;t forget what we talked about in your final debriefing: you can expect there to be some challenges with integrating your recent experiences into life back at home. Remember, your Live Different Build will have impacted you to live differently, but not everyone will get that - and that&apos;s ok. However, now that you can start exploring ways to live different, we want to help you get a head start on what that can look like.

We all have our favourite stories and friends that we met, and are excited whenever we have the chance to share and be a voice for them. We hope that you will start to do the same. There are so many other ways you can use your own life to change the world, and we want to invite you to begin to experience it for yourself by choosing to LIVE DIFFERENT every day.

Why not contact your local news channel and/or newspaper and brag up your experience? You could use it as an opportunity to challenge the way people view their own lives and maybe you could catapult yourself into local humanitarian stardom - or at least on to the local breakfast television slot!
SHARE YOUR STORY! (Did we mention that already?) Remember those little 30 second, 2 minute, and 10 minute stories we talked about? They are dying to be told and celebrated!
Stay in contact with your new Live Different Build friends. Together you can do more than just re-live laughter and tears - you can challenge, brainstorm, and network together, one action at a time.
Send thank you notes to everyone who helped you go on your Live Different Build in the first place - or, at the very least, tag them in the Facebook photos! Remember, Nan and Pop love you and want to know what they spent your early inheritance on - and your neighbours whose kids you have babysat for years want to know that you are honestly nice to kids all over the world.
If you are a student going back to school, what are the first steps you can take now to plan out and start up a social justice group or advocacy campaign to run throughout the next school year, or even hosting your own assembly in your school or community?
What can you do now to begin organizing a Live Different Build group for next year? Why not consider joining us at another one of our locations and bringing along some new faces with you?


Feel free to check out our summer internship opportunities that we have available in both Dominican Republic and Mexico; or, perhaps you are interested in being a part of what we do on a much bigger scale. If so, you might be interested in our Live Different Academy that is available to anyone who has graduated from high school, where over four months, you live in Mexico, completing a leadership development and social justice curriculum.

Our website is a resource for you. If you can&apos;t find what you are looking for, email us and demand to know why!

Remember: your life is powerful. You can be a big part of continuing to make a difference right where you are.
