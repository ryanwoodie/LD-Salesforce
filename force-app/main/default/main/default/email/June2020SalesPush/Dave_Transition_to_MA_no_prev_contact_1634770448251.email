<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}!<br />
<br />
I am reaching out to educators I’ve worked with the past few years while organizing school presentations with LiveDifferent. I wanted to give you a heads up that as of next week, I will be moving into a new job and Mary Anne will be the person you can connect with regarding our online assemblies and other school programming. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Mary Anne’s email address is: maryanne@livedifferent.com and she’d be thrilled to help you with all things youth empowerment and LiveDifferent related :-)<br />
<br />
She is planning on reaching out to you sometime today as well to introduce herself directly.<br />
<br />
It has been a pleasure working with you, and I wish you all the best!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Dave<br />
