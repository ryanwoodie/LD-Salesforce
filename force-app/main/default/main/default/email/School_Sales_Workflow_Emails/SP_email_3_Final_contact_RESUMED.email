Hi {!Account.SP_First_Name__c},

Happy New Year! I contacted you a couple of times before Christmas regarding Live Different's school presentation, but haven't heard back from you yet. Of course, in the world of email, this is a totally normal delay, so don't feel bad at all :-) !  I apologize for being so persistent; we find school email systems can be very inconsistent, and we really don't want your students to miss out on a life-changing opportunity because of an email delivery issue!

So, I will appreciate it so much to get a short reply. Feel free to respond with nothing but a date when we should try to contact you again, or even a simple "no thanks".

Kindest Regards,

Brittany Henderson
