<p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>

<p>I trust this email finds you well and that your week is off to a great start!</p>

<p>I'm following up on my recent email regarding Mental Health Month in May. Have you given any more thought about bringing in LiveDifferent for an Assembly and workshops that could support your students’ mental wellbeing?</p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);">I wanted to share a quote from the Vice Principal at a school we were at this past Fall, who gave us a 10/10:</span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);"><em>"Absolutely engaging! Students came alive talking about the assembly all day. Students report that this was the </em></span><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);"><strong><em>best mental health related</em></strong></span><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);"><em> session that we have had here!"</em></span></p>

<p>In case you didn’t know, LiveDifferent also has long-term mental wellness programming called Circles Peer-Mentorship Curriculum.&nbsp; Click to check out our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pD0LSwQ1cj0nnLCpgeWSZhGJrX4OXT2r/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">23/24 Circles Programming PDF</span></a><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>for you to learn more.</p>

<p>I believe that your students would greatly benefit from the unique and dynamic program we offer, whether it’s for a day or over a school year.</p>

<p>I'd be happy to set up a brief call to discuss available dates or what a visit from LiveDifferent could look like at your school. Just click <a href="https://calendar.app.google/YkSHZ7uDDaPF54536" target="_blank"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">HERE </span></a>to find a time that works for you!&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Warm regards,<br />
