Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

On behalf of our staff, volunteers, and the thousands of lives that will be affected by our programs this year, we would like to say a huge THANK YOU for becoming a monthly donor. We are grateful for your support and hope that you will stay engaged in Live Different in the future!

Your monthly supports helps us to spark pivotal life change in those we encounter through our strategically linked programs:

Live Different Presentations - High school motivational assemblies that reach thousands of students each year with a message of hope, purpose, and perspective. This program also encompasses our Road Team Internships, which are exciting, hands-on opportunities to gain experience working with a non-profit, and to make a difference in the lives of young people all across Canada.

Live Different Builds - International humanitarian trips where volunteers are given the opportunity to make a difference in the developing world as we build houses, schools, and other much needed projects.

Live Different Academy - A 4-month post-secondary program where our students are hosted at our Live Different base in Mexico, working in the community and experiencing social justice first-hand. Students are transformed in their thinking, their actions, and their focus for the future.

We have added you to the Live Different newsletter that is sent out every few months, which will keep you updated with everything that is going on with our programs, and will allow you to see how your contributions are at work! If you would not like to receive our newsletter, please reply to this email to let us know.

Live Different believes in open, transparent communication with our donors and partners and we welcome your input, questions, or comments. Please feel free to either call our office at 1-866-432-4464 or email us at  cindy@livedifferent.com or  charles@livedifferent.com.

Thank you for partnering with us, and for your continued support of Live Different!
