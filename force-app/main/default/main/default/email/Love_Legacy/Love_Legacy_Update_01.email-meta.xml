    <subject>Follow a Build in Haiti on Instagram this week!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

School is almost out for the summer at Ecole L&apos;Union. There are just a few days left, and we have a team on a Build in Haiti right now! They will be working on the foundation in the top corner of the school yard, as well as helping tile the classroom floors.

In order to give everyone a better glimpse of what goes on during a Build in Haiti we have turned our Instagram account over to our staff, Jamie and Jasmine for the next few days. They will be leading the Build, and will be posting Instagram stories. We would love for you to follow along!

To see these stories, you will need to follow us on Instagram from your mobile phone. Our account is @livediff (https://www.instagram.com/livediff/), but please note that the desktop browser version will not show these &apos;stories&apos;.

Next week I will send some after pics of the work so you can see what they accomplish.

Enjoy!
