    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

My name is Jennifer, I am the Program Administrator for the Academy, I am very excited to know you will be joining us for this 13 week journey! I have just sent out the reference forms to your references. Please let them know to fill them out as soon as possible.



After they have filled out the forms and your references check out, I will be sending you an acceptance email with all of the next steps.

Have a great week!

Please feel free to call or email me to answer any questions that you or your parents may have. I am always available to you at the contact information below. Please do not be shy in calling or emailing; if you don&apos;t know, just ask. I&apos;m here to help!

Sincerely,

Jennifer Quong
