    <subject>The feedback is in: Schools are transforming with our Free Peer Mentorship Program</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},

We wanted to follow up about LiveDifferent&apos;s Peer Mentorship Curriculum, now available for FREE! Here&apos;s what educators and students are saying about the impact:

&quot;This program was an exceptional experience for our students. The students really had a chance to engage in conversation, with direct instruction on how to listen to each other, how to empathize, and how to reflect on themselves. The skills that they were learning were those that are often difficult to teach, and yet so important.&quot; 

- Danielle Chopik, Jesse Ketchum Junior and Senior Public School, Toronto

Key Benefits of the Program:
 - Build Authentic Community: Foster strong connections and a sense of belonging among students.
 - Develop Leadership Skills: Empower students with the tools and confidence to lead.
 - Encourage Personal Growth: Promote critical personal development areas such as empathy, resilience, and values.
 - Compassion Project: Culminates in a student-led project that benefits their community or a community abroad, reinforcing the importance of altruism and social responsibility.

Here&apos;s how one student described their experience:

&quot;Sharing experiences in the circles made me feel like I belonged... I learned a lot about helping people, not just friends but also in my neighborhood and community. Hearing people&apos;s experiences on how they help the community inspired me to do similar things. The Circles also changed my view on the world and my attitude towards certain situations.&quot; 

- Student, Streetsville Secondary School, Mississauga, ON
