<p>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},</p>

<p>I hope your spring is going well! I am getting in touch with all our Live
Different Consultants to give you an update on where planning is at for
next year's school presentation.  Thank you SO MUCH for your ongoing support and help. So many students have been impacted this year because of the program improvements resulting from the input our
consultants provided last spring and fall - I cannot emphasize enough how
critically valuable your help is.</p>

<p>We sent an initial survey to our consultants and other educators a few
weeks ago to get input on what issues and challenges they feel students are
currently facing. The following link gives a summary of what they told us, a sneak peak at where our
2015-16 message is headed, and the opportunity for feedback on it:</p>

<p style='text-align:center'><a href='http://www.tfaforms.com/forms/view/370531?tfa_75={!Contact.Id}' style='text-decoration:none;background-color:#00b9f2;text-align:center;padding:8px;border-radius:5px;color:#FFFFFF'>Click to see next year's theme and give feedback</a></p>

<p>If you feel you don't have the time to fill the survey, I would even
appreciate a quick reply to acknowledge you received this email (we are
curious if there were email delivery issues on our previous
correspondence). If you have any questions or concerns, or would rather
give your input directly or verbally, feel free to call or email me
anytime, I would be pleased to speak with you.</p>

<p>Kindest Regards,</p>
Ryan Wood<br><br>
